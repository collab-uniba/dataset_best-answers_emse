Try this first and update me with the results.* Updating the metadata stored procedures required by ODBC, OLE DB and  jConnect Drivers on Adaptive Server Enterprise Certain new features and bug fixes in ODBC, OLE DB and jConnect drivers  require you to modify the metadata stored procedures in Adaptive Server.  These stored procedures may not be up-to-date on your host ASE server due  to various reasons. If the metadata stored procedures are outdated, you may not be able to use  some of the fixes that are implemented in this SP/ESD, so you will need to  manually install the updated metadata stored procedures. To update the metadata stored procedures in Adaptive Server, first determine  the version of the meta-data scripts installed on the ASE. To do so, execute  the following command: sp_version go The version number of the ODBC, OLE DB and jConnect meta-data scripts will  be displayed. Review the version number column and compare it against the version of the  driver being used.  If the metadata scripts are outdated, the version installed will be older  than the driver build number or you will encounter one of the following: - stored procedure sp_version is not found - the stored procedure output does not print a row for the driver The updated scripts are included with the drivers and can be installed as  follows: For ODBC & OLE DB: - Go the \"sp\" directory under the ODBC/OLE DB installation directory - Execute the install_odbc_sprocs script for the ODBC Driver and  install_oledb_sprocs script for OLE DB Provider. Syntax for using the script is: install_[odbc/olebd]_sprocs <ServerName> <username> [<password>] where <ServerName> is the name of the Adaptive Server <username> is the username to connect to the server [<password>] is the password the username (dont supply this for null password) For jConnect: - Go to the \"sp\" directory under the jConnect installation directory. Based  on your host ASE server version, choose the appropriate SQL script.  - Use isql or another tool of your choice to execute the selected script.  This will install the current meta-data stored procedures.Thanks,Dawn Kim", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:ODBC 16.00.00.02 return wrong data", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

'out of the box' you'll likely find yourself with an unwanted mixing of libraries due to the mish-mash of incompatible user and system variable settings.Similar issues can arise if you try to install different Sybase products on Windows where said Sybase products are based on different releases of the SDK (eg, running ASE 15.1 and Repserver 15.7.1 would likely see major runtime issues). Again, the problems come down to an unwanted mixing of libraries due to the mish-mash of user and system variables.NOTE: You may have better luck installing different ASE versions on a Windows *server* where each ASE version is installed under a different user/login.Personally, I would never try installing different ASE versions on the same Windows (non-server platform) machine other than as a step to upgrade the older ASE version with the newer ASE version.----------------As for the need to unzip the files on linux ... that doesn't sound right.

I had installed some product that set SYBASE variable but this product had no Connectivity - no interfaces file (sql.ini) and no charsets resource.One of the reasons to get this error is if you deploy the Provider to the system without installing the SDK, the lack of charsets folder under the SYBASE root directory can cause this error to happen - so say for example ASE is cp850. The Windows client is normally cp1252. By default Provider connects to ASE to use cp850 as code page (charset) and without the resource in charsets for mappings, due to how the Provider handles conversions internally (it is natively Unicode internally) it's possible with the charsets resource the error occurs.Now I know Windows 8 is different than Windows 2012. But there shouldn't be significant changes in how to handle charsets unless, as stated, SYBASE\\charsets is missing. I have requested to integrate charsets into the DLL but this isn't looking to be happening. However, one thing to try, if this description is the case is to create a SYBASE directory on the machine in question, copy charsets to it, set a SYBASE variable to the SYBASE directory created, then test Provider under this environment with default properties to see if this works.At the least it would be an interim resolution. If I find these types of issues keep happening I'll crank up the noise on the feature logged. There is also possibility to provide some connection option to locate this charset resource on machine provided it is copied to the machine. I don't have details yet on this until we complete implementation later this year.Cheers,-Paul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Connecting to ASE 15.7 from Windows Server 2012", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

These stored procedures may not be up-to-date on your host ASE server due  to various reasons. If the metadata stored procedures are outdated, you may not be able to use  some of the fixes that are implemented in this SP/ESD, so you will need to  manually install the updated metadata stored procedures. To update the metadata stored procedures in Adaptive Server, first determine  the version of the meta-data scripts installed on the ASE. To do so, execute  the following command: sp_version go The version number of the ODBC, OLE DB and jConnect meta-data scripts will  be displayed. Review the version number column and compare it against the version of the  driver being used.  If the metadata scripts are outdated, the version installed will be older  than the driver build number or you will encounter one of the following: - stored procedure sp_version is not found - the stored procedure output does not print a row for the driver The updated scripts are included with the drivers and can be installed as  follows: For ODBC & OLE DB: - Go the \"sp\" directory under the ODBC/OLE DB installation directory - Execute the install_odbc_sprocs script for the ODBC Driver and  install_oledb_sprocs script for OLE DB Provider. Syntax for using the script is: install_[odbc/olebd]_sprocs <ServerName> <username> [<password>] where <ServerName> is the name of the Adaptive Server <username> is the username to connect to the server [<password>] is the password the username (dont supply this for null password) For jConnect: - Go to the \"sp\" directory under the jConnect installation directory.

Storage hierarchies vary wildly. Query/transaction profiles are different (complex, to simple queries that may not need updated stats as much). My extremely flat table design might require different considerations from your highly normalized design. I might want to run 6 concurrent update stats jobs because I have 8 engines and I know that pushes my OS io limits, and my tempdb is a SSD, and my maintenance window is only 2 hours before another batch job starts. Yours might/will be different. etc.Best thing you can do is write your own for your environment taking into consideration a number of factors specific to your environment. You would also have to have a way to determine (or estimate) when it actually makes sense to update stats on a per table/index/colum basis, or settle for some kind of shotgun approach.Make use of parallel jobs/engines as much as it makes sense to.I've seen others use metrics from derived_stat() to determine threshold criteria. datachange() can be a fast way to determine which update stats table/index/column to skip, but you gotta lookout for the conditions that reset this reading between interations of your update stats jobs.Also, some of the cluster ratios returned by derived_stat() might be misleading until CR counts are updated by.... update stats. And oh, by the way, what is your setting for \"sysstatistics flush interval\"? That setting is disabled by default. Reading from derived_stat() and datachange() could be affected there.Lots of variabled to consider - probably explains the lack of a \"general' rule-of-thumb type of script.

On dynamic builds an update of client library provides access to the new libraries.For Windows, I don't think there really is a concept of static libraries since you use DLLs (as Simon points out). You do link to the libsybct.lib, etc in your application project but the application accesses the DLLs during runtime. I don't think we provide a static windows library for client library functions.Cheers,-Paul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Static library for Sybase CT library (Windows, Linux)", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

This is the most current driver release. In that release is also the ODBC/sp directory- For a test it would be a good idea to install ESD#7, and then update ASE procedures from the ODBC/sp folder, by running install_odbc_sprocs ASEName UserName Password. Make sure you can restore procedures to ASE if something doesn't work properly here. Whatever you did last - whether it was the ODBC/sp from 15.7.0.80 (backup this folder before applying ESD#7 just in case) or the ASE installmaster scriptIt is possible we have a script not proper in the releases for sp_drv_typeinfo. I vaguely remember issue with this one a long time ago, years ago, and maybe some adjustment is required - we'd like for the sproc package to work properly from release. What I suggest is if ESD#7 isn't working, that is, you need to manually change that script for this to work, you can use it as a workaround. Then log a support case with us so we can report it to engineering.If ESD#7 works, then consider the problem solved. We won't go back to any 15.0 releases to make same adjustment since, as I mentioned, 15.7 is a continuation of 15.5 which is a contuation of 15.0.Lastly, if you can't access the downloads let me know in the post. I'll find out how to get it. i assume you're properly licensed for ASE 15.7 so I think you ought to be able to obtain the ESD downloads. Keep in mind the SDK ESDs are full installs, so if you have a machine to test with without any ASE SDK software you can install the SDK 15.7 ESD#7 as a complete installation. Or alternatively, you can install over the previous installation (just back up the software before applying the ESD#7 installation).Cheers,-Paul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:ASE odbc 15.7 return numericColAttribute with -999 of SQL_COLUMN_SEARCHABLE", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

This is one of the quirks of TSQL that will drive crazy if you can't just accept it.When you send in a SQL batch, it goes through several steps of processing - parsing, object resolution, normalization, compilation (optimization), and execution.This error is raised during the object resolution stage as the query tree is being built. At this point ASE doesn't know if the table will or will not exist at the future time when the IF statement will actually be executed, but it does know that the table exists at this moment and so is incompatible with the CREATE statement. It doesn't know whether to put the actual current object identifier in the query tree for this and subsequent statements in the batch, or the placeholder for a newly created table.The docs mention this under the entry for IF..ELSEhttp://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.help.ase_15.0.commands/html/commands/commands61.htmWhen a create table command occurs within an if...else block or a while loop, Adaptive Server creates the schema for the table before determining whether the condition is true. This may lead to errors if the table already exists. To avoid this situation, either make sure a view with the same name does not already exist in the database or use an execute statement, as follows:if not exists (select * from sysobjects where name=\"my table\") begin  execute (\"create table mytable(x int)\") end[Note that I've corrected the above example, the entry in the docs is missing the open and close parenthesis around the executed string]This avoids the error because the contents of an EXECUTE command aren't parsed until the EXECUTE itself is actually executed..The sp_configure parameter \"defered name resolution\" (or SET option) can avoid the error in some cases in code within stored procedures, but not ad-hoc statements. But learning to write using the EXECUTE logic results in code that always works.Documentation on \"defered name resolution\":http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.help.ase_15.0.commands/html/commands/commands61.htm-bret", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:What is wrong with this TSQL script (check and create table) ?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Incidentally you can use the older proeprty names to make connection but I encourage you to use the SAP Sybase driver (Adaptive Server Enterprise) and start using the newer connections when it is convenient to do so.So this connection string, using the SAP SYbase driver:driver={Adaptive Server Enterprise};NA=localhost,1570;uid=sa;pwd=**;passwordencryption=1Should also work.

I don't think this should impact things as it doesn't appear you are doing any sort of scrolling in the cursor. So by default the FORWARD_ONLY will retrieve the data and apparently handles the size correctly. It looks like there is some sort of problem with the STATIC cursor. If you want to have this investigated you can open a Tech Support case and I can log this with Engineering to resolve in the future. If you're okay to use the FORWARD_ONLY cursor, go with that and I will log an internal CR for the STATIC cursor problem. I think that setting should work anyway but at this time I haven't figured out why it isn't working.

The TDS trace shows a select receving only a row count and no information about a result set until AFTER the second call is sent to ASE. This looks very much like some known problems with the ASE kernel mode and are resolved, as you know, in SP100. By changing to the process mode your performance shouldn't be any worse than the older ASE. I would think still faster but testing has to be performed to really determine that since ever site is different in all manners of it's data processing/storage, etc. Without any real details about what your process is all about no one could really answer the question.However, with similar cases with the TDS problem, folks who switched to process mode didn't report adverse affects on their performance. My recommendation is to switch mode now, test ytour app(s) and check performance. In the near term I would then plan to upgrade to the 15.7 SP100 or later. It would be to your benefit.Cheers,-Paul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Bind errors after upgarding sybase from ASE 12 to ASE15.7", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Now we have created a separate namespace within db2 in sybase. So application only connects with db2, but with different users and in separate schemas. Application is in java and connecting to db server using jcon3 driver library. It is using SybXADataSource driver class (provided by jcon3 jar) to connect to the server. Till last week application was able to connect to the server, everything was working fine (though I must say that code is still not optimized to use connection pools etc., I am opening a connection, and closing it for every request). For sometime, I have been facing an issue from the server- login failed, try again. In the server error logs I found it was throwing an error- \"Error 1601 Severity 17 state 3: no user connections available to run the process\" I checked for available connections (using sp_configure), allowed connections are 900, and total active connection at the time this error shows up is typically between 30- 100 (using sp_monitorconfig). Seems like this is well within limits. Also yesterday, I did one more exercise, I restarted the server and logged in as sa from isql console only. Logged out and logged in again afimeter 20 minutes (no application connection was made), and isql login again gave this error. So I am inclined to think that something could be wrong with server configuration as well. Server is on linux red hat.   I have searched all the db forums and SCN website as well, and all of these refer to one resolution of increasing the number of connections, but as from my observation regarding that, I do not think it is an issue.

To get through the migration (to ASE 15.x) I suggested getting back to comparable12.5 level performance by switching to allrows_oltp. We completed the (re)testing of all procs in less time than had already been spent trying to force every query of every proc to run under allrows_mix. Then we manually tweaked the (relatively) few procs that could benefit from merge joins (though in most cases we opted for hash joins since it eliminated most of the worktable overhead of merge joins).Another client insisted on using allrows_mix and manually having to tweak large quantities of of their queries (stored procs and standalone queries). Yeah, they jumped through the hoops of trying to make merge joins run faster, failed to make any noticeable improvement, and continued on with forcing allrows_mix. They gave responses similar to yours when I suggested using allrows_oltp as their default setting soooo, it took awhile to work through their query inventory.The first client understood the benefit of the KISS principle, and saved time by switching to allrows_oltp, which in turn free'd up my time to work on the more interesting/challenging performance issues (eg, improving EOD processing so they wouldn't overrun their SLAs). The second client eventually got their inventory 'tuned' but it took a looong time to get to the finish line with allrows_mix (thankfully I work on an hourly basis).", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Bad Performance of Merge Join", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Unfortunately for every client I've worked with ... ASE 15.x, and the default of allrows_mix, did just the opposite, ie, migrations took much longer than expected/planned due primarily to huge performance degradation across their SQL inventory.For most of my clients merge joins were rarely, if ever, used in ASE 12.5.x. And since hash joins never existed, that leaves us with using nested loop joins in ASE 15.x in an attempt to stay as close to ASE 12.5.x in terms of performance.NOTE: No, I don't consider compatibility mode as a solution as this requires you go through 2 migrations ... once to compatibility mode ... and eventually once to get off of compatibility mode.Now, can merge joins improve the performance of *some* queries? Absolutely, but in practice ... especially with the first 4-5 years of ASE 15.x releases ... merge joins caused more headaches and performance degradation than they were worth. I've seen too many clients spend huge amounts of time trying to re-write code to work with merge joins, often failing and having to 'regress back' to nested loop joins in the end.Unfortunately a) Sybase delivered ASE 15.x with allows_mix as the default and b) most companies didn't have enough migration experience to understand the pitfalls of trying to run all of their queries under the default of allrows_mix. This meant that many companies were left having to 'regress back' to alternative solutions (eg, allrows_oltp, compat mode, don't migrate, move to another RDBMS) to address the performance degradation introduced with ASE 15.x and the default setting of allrows_mix.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Bad Performance of Merge Join", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

While you got it to work by removing the parentheses, I'm wondering if this is just a 'lucky' side effect of how the preparecall() construct works ... perhaps if preparecall() can't parse the input it 'just' sends the input as a string of text (perhaps routes the string through preparestatement()) and hopes the RDBMS can parse/compile the string ... *shrug*", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Strange error while executing a stored procedure: Incorrect syntax near '@p0'", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

[NOTE: I don't use the GUI ... I'm an 'old' command line type of person ... so I don't have a lot of details on the inner workings of the GUI.]The error you're receiving has to do with the GUI trying to obtain some metadata (that's what the sp_jdbc_primarykey stored proc is used for) prior to it running the sp_activeroles stored proc. The CLI does not need this metadata (ie, it does *not* call sp_jdbd_primarykey) so it doesn't generate an error. In neither case is the actual sp_activeroles stored proc invocation failing.------------------Since this is a new ASE 16 instance I'm wondering if perhaps some of the jdbc-related procs need to be manually loaded (though this may also depend on how you created the ASE 16 instance, too).I'd suggest posting back with the complete output from running sp_version (via the CLI to eliminate errors).In the meantime you could also try loading the latest/greatest set of jdbc/jConnect related stored procs.On the host where ASE is running, under %SYBASE% you should see a directory named jConnect* (pick the one with the highest number in the name), then under the 'sp' subdirectory should be a collection of sql_server*sql scripts. Hopefully there's a version of the file with a '16' in the name.Load the sql_server*16*sql script into your ASE 16 instance with the CLI, eg: isql -S SYBASE1600 -U ... -P ... -i sqlserver*16*sqlThen try running your sp_activeroles query from the GUI.NOTE: I don't have a copy of ASE 16 in front of me at the time so if in doubt about the above directions then post the output from the following:=======================-- from windows DOS prompt:cd %SYBASE%dir-- for each jConn* directory, cd to jConn*/sp and get a list of filescd jConnect...cd spdir=======================------------------Also ...Where are you running the GUI from? The same host as the ASE 16 instance, or a different host?Do you still get your errors if running the GUI from the host where ASE 16 is running?[If running the GUI from an older Sybase software installation I'm wondering if there could be some compatibility issues with running the older GUI against ASE 16 ... hence the suggestion to try running the GUI that comes with ASE 16.]", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:getting below error while exec procedure 'sp_activeroles' on SAP Sybase ASE 16", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Open Server 16.x is certified with ASE 15.7. The major thing I see with your old application using old dblibs is if you have DBVERSION set to using tds 4.2. You will want to make sure the application is using DBVERSION_100 in the application, which basically makes the application use tds 5.x which is the current standard. I have seen the old flavor of tds cause stacks in the newer ASEs.Also note the compile line changed since the older 10.0.4.And the binary names for the libraries you need also changed. Also note when you compile on the newer Linux systems your switches that are added to the compile will have also changed.You can always look at the samples for dblibs included in the SDK for SAP ASE to see sample compile lines and switches used.You honestly should upgrade the application to ctlibs to handle speed performance and threading for the faster ASE.I hope this helps with moving and migrating the application.Dawn", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:What flavour and version of Linux for Openserver", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Instead, the dump can be loaded as an archive database and just that table bcped out (or selected into a table in the main database). The data in that recovered table would be a bit stale compared to the rest of the database, but that might be preferable to losing hours of work.Note that an alternative method for a more up to date recovery is possible if tran log dumps were being taken, the full dump could be loaded and then the tran log dumps up to the one covering the time where the table was dropped, that last tran dump could then be loaded using the \"with until_time\" option to just before the table was dropped.There are other uses to Archive Databases, but access to object-level data without actually loading the full dump was the main business case for it.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Need of archive Datbase in Sybase ASE", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

I'm part of the group that reviews new messages, and conserving the shrinking pool of available numbers is certainly a concern of ours. We are actually still some ways away from running out of numbers.The error numbers are actually a concatenation of a major family number (the 100s values)and minor numbers 0-99 in each family. There are many families of errors that have unused values, one possibility is that we could use those unused values for errors that don't really belong in that family. Another thing we can do (though it would have to be in a major release of both open client and ASE) would be to introduce another mechanism that might work just the same as error messages but be called, say, \"notifications\" or \"faults' (though that term is already used by checkstorage.There actually already exist two such families of messages, one called \"errors\" and the other called \"messages\". You can see this when configuring a shared memory dump, both are possible dump conditions. \"Errors\" show up in the errorlog displaying the message number, severity, and a state value, while \"Messages\" just display text and support has to look up the associated message number in the ASE sourcecode. (Not all text messages in the log are actual messages like this, some are just text that gets printed that one can't configure a memory dump on.)Cheers,-bret", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Will ASE system defined error number fall into user defined error numbers starting from 20000?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

For variable commands the SQL developer can populate a local @variable with the desired command(s) and then issue exec(@variable).2 - Any stored procs created in the sybsystemprocs database with a prefix of 'sp_' can be executed from within any database in the dataserver. You're likely familiar with quite a few of these procs that come with ASE, eg, sp_who, sp_help*, sp_configure, etc. There's nothing to keep the DBA from adding his/her own sp_* procs to the sybsystemprocs database so that they can be executed from within any database.3 - When executing a stored proc, if you preface the proc name with '<dbname>..', said proc will be executed from within the <dbname> database ... just as if you had issued 'use <dbname>' followed by 'exec <procname>...'. In the following example, the user is sitting in the master database but viewing the contents of the testdb database:==================use mastergo-- run the sp_helpdb proc in the testdb databaseexec testdb..sp_helpgo... list of all objects in the testdb database==================------------Using all of these features it's possible to create a sp_* proc that accepts a long string; a string that contains your desired command(s).The sp_* proc can then be run in any database by simply prefacing the sp_* call with the name of the database.For example:==================-- give my proc dataserver-wide access by creating-- in the sybsystemprocs database with a prefix of 'sp_'use sybsystemprocsgo-- I tend to add an extra '_' to distinguish my custom procs from-- those provided by SAP/Sybaseif object_id('sp__execute_command') is not NULL drop proc sp__execute_commandgocreate proc sp__execute_command@command varchar(16384)asexec(@command)go-- grant permissions as you see fitgrant execute on sp__execute_command to publicgo-- while sitting in the master database ...use mastergo-- create a new table in the testdb database, and-- grant 'select' to the public groupexec testdb..sp__execute_command 'create table t1 (a int, b int) grant select on t1 to public'go-- let's go see if it worked ...use testdbgosp_help t1goName Owner Object_type Object_stats Create_date---- ----- ----------- -------------------- -------------------t1 dbo user table keep first text page May 29 2015 9:04PM... snip ...sp_helprotect t1gograntor grantee type action object column predicate grantable------- ------- ----- ------ ------ ------ --------- ---------dbo public Grant Select t1 All NULL FALSE==================------------This is a very basic example. Keep in mind ...- the caller is responsible for submitting a) syntactically correct commands and b) knowing which commands can in fact be submitted via the exec() construct- you'll find that most exec() calls that deal with DDL commands usually cannot be run inside a transaction sooo, do you add some checks to verify you're not in a txn before making the exec() call, or leave this up to the caller to address as s/he sees fit?- you'll need to decide who has permissions to execute the sp_* proc; alternatively add logic in the proc to verify the caller's credentials in the database where the proc is executed- I'm not 100% sure the exec() can actually handle a 16K string ... so you'll need to test that out if you plan on submitting some really long commands", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:How can i Switch database inside procedure in Sybase ASE", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Next, batch job 1a ran that night in its normal 6 seconds. About 24 hours later, we let the batch run on its own so 1a runs first in 6 seconds, but 1b runs in its normal 20 minutes again!Experiment 2) Force job 1b to always run first, followed by 1a. This resulted in job 1b always running in 35 seconds, followed by 1a running in 6 seconds!QuestionNow one solution we have is to force a dependency so that 1a depends on 1b before execution, however we'd like to decouple these jobs as they really shouldn't depend on each other from a data perspective. Does anyone know what the problem is and what the possible solutions may be?One theory I have is that the procedure cache is coming into play here, but, if that is the case, I don't know how to fix this unless I create a new stored procedure maybe with the same name?

If no such plans reside in cache then the proc is (re)compiled and a new set of query plans is generated/used.Over time if a proc is not used its query plans can be flushed from cache, thus requiring a (re)compilation the next time the proc runs. (This would explain what you saw in Experiment #1, ie, after 24 hours the query plans were flushed from cache so 1a generated a new set of plans when it ran, followed by 1b re-using a 'bad' set of plans.)If you don't plan on running this proc very often (eg, thousands of times a day) you can tell Sybase to recompile the proc when it's run. You'll incur a small amount of cpu/compilation overhead each time the proc is compiled, but said compilation time is likely much smaller than the savings you'll get from making sure 1b always gets a 'good' query plan.You have a couple (relatively) easy options for forcing the proc to recompile when it's run:1 - explicitly force a recompilation when you execute the proc; this example assumes 'isql' command line (I'm not sure how you'd add the 'with recompile' clause to your application): execute my_proc \"humans\" with recompileNOTE: If you do run this proc a lot, you could supply the 'with recompile' clause for just those instances where you know you need to generate a new/good set of query plans.2 - force a recompilation every time the proc is executed create proc my_proc (@arg varchar(100)) with recompile as ... snip ...-------------As for why test always runs fast but prod shows slowness, could be a few different issues ...1 - different index structures in the 2 environments2 - columns with different datatypes in the 2 environments3 - different volume or distribution of data in the 2 environments4 - different sets of stats in the 2 environments (eg, test has had 'update index stats' run, while prod had 'update stats' run)5 - test always has a copy of the fast/1b query plan in cacheAddressing any/all of these issues may allow 1b to run fast all the time in prod (without the 'with recompile' clause), but that'll require digging into the 2 environments to see where the performance difference is coming from ...", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Stored procedure runs extremely slow in certain scenarios", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

This is likely ok if the proc is not executed very often and/or the compilation overhead is minimal. On the other hand, using this method for a proc that is executed a lot of times in a short period of time, or which requires a high overhead for compilation, could degrade performance not only for most of the folks running the proc but also eat up precious dataserver cpu cycles that could be better used elsewhere.At one client there was a developer who saw how well 'create proc ... w/recompile' worked for a particular batch process (ie, proc was not called very often, and the forced recompilation meant the difference of the proc running in 2 minutes vs 5+ hrs), that he decided to use 'create proc ... w/recompile' for another proc that would occasionally go walkabout. The problem with his solution ... this particular proc was called ... literally ... a million times a day; said proc normally ran in something like 6ms; the forced recompilation for *every* execution of the proc added upwards of 80ms to each execution of the proc, bumped up overall dataserver cpu usage by 350%, and caused a lot of contention on the system tables used for compilation. In that particular case we had to spend more time understanding why the proc went walkabout and then come up with a solution that did not require excessive use of 'with recompile'.--------------------------------As for your proc cache question ...I suggest you run some tests and pay attention to what happens to the contents of master..monCachecProcedures (mCP).In particular, pay attention to a) the number of entries in mCP for your proc and b) how mCP.CompileDate changes when a proc is (re)compiled.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Stored procedure runs extremely slow in certain scenarios", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

This is why in the documentation it states that it can swamp proc cache with many plans for this procedure if you execute in this manner repeatedly.Disadvantages to either approach only really concern repeated executions, in tight loops for example.

We don't certify by II 8.0. We do certify by compiler insofar as to support integration in Visual Studio and .NET framework.SDK 15.7 we support 2.0 and 4.0 .NETSDK 16.0 we support 3.5 (replaces 2.0), 4.0 and 4.5. Of course there might be limitations in feature support and we can handle that on case-by-case basis.Integration into Visual Studio relies on some registry settings for DDEX - our installation process is catching up on the automation of setting up the user for DDEX and we can manually overcome that with registry settings.If coding with .NET 4.0 on IIS 8, then use the 4.0 Provider. If you want to go 4.5 then use 4.5 provider. Both use the same un-managed layer so I don't think going to higher API makes difference in this situation. We need to maybe see what tds looks like when issue occurs again with the Access violation. Is this reproducible in test environment?

Can you please let us know how, exactly, do you deploy the provider?When AseConnection is invoked, the Provider contains the un-managed DLLs, embedded in it's own DLL. These are copied to location, like in this case maybe C:\\windows\\temp\\ because it is IIS doing this.It is unusual to be denied access to the Windows\\TEMP directory and this is happening on new connections - this wasn't happening before in the access violation - in that situation you are connecting , etc. So what changed in this case? Something did since the Provider doesn't spontaneously decide itself don't have rights to a specific directory - this is something happening externally.This directory:'C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\Sybase.AdoNet4.AseClient.64bits.4.157.1300.0is where the Provider copies the proper version of sybdrvado20.dll - this is the un-managed layer handling the TDS - the communication to the ASE. When the constructor:Sybase.Data.AseClient.AseConnection..ctor(System.String)call is invoked, the Provider first checks for existence of that directory, then if not, creates directory and copies the platform specific version of the sybdrvado20.dll there. If it exists, it loads that DLL. In your case it is clearly being denied access to the directory and this isn't making sense.The only thing I can think of now is the directory was initially created by one app pool, with a specific ID and now another app pool is trying to access and has no rights to this directory. Can you check this? See if app pools are using different windows ids?Also, please find the specific rights for the 'C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\Sybase.AdoNet4.AseClient.64bits.4.157.1300.0 directory - you can look at the directory properties, and check Security I think - this should list the users and their access rights. The app pool users require full access to the directory.Cheers,-Paul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:System.AccessViolationException in 64 bit ASE client on server", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},
