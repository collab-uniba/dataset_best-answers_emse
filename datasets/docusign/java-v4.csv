Can the JSON be put into a Java String just as the XML is and then inserted into the requestBody string or must the JSON be transformed into some type of Java object?

The Python sample in particular does it by building a single string and using that in the request- so to answer your question- yes you can put the JSON (or XML) formatted data into a single string.  I'm pasting the python string here for your review but I'm pretty sure the formatting will get messed up, you probably just want to copy it from the website...

Is there a means to implement EmbeddedDocusign by supplying it with as ActAsUser so the API user can authenticate on the behalf of a DocuSign user so that when the MemberConsole token URL is returned, it returns the token for a MemberConsole session for say Fred.Flintstone@hp.com as opposed to the API user account session? We accomplished something similar using EmbeddedSending with the SOBO user, so am wondering if there is a corollary to the SOBO user for use with EmbeddedDocuSign that we would need to add to the X-DocuSign-Authentication string (<SendOnBehlafOf> tags were added to the auth string on EmbeddedSending)?

I just ran a test for this locally and I was able to get it to work.  The basic premise is that I have an account with two users (we'll say User1 and User2) and they have permissions to use Act-As authentication through their account settings (I think only User1 needs this though).  
 
I already had an oAuth token stored for User2 from a previous test, and it sounds like you've been able to get this to work for other use cases (i.e. Embedded Sending) so I'm assuming you have your oAuth steps working correctly.  I copied the (PHP) code from APIWalkthrough for Embedded DocuSign and then in the second request (i.e. Get Console View) I setup the request like the following:
 
// // STEP 2 - get the console view // $data = array(""accountId"" => $accountId);
$data_string = json_encode($data);  $curl = curl_init($baseUrl . ""/views/console"" ); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data_string);  curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(  'Content-Type: application/json',  'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data_string), ""X-DocuSign-Act-As-User: $emailOnBehalf"", ""Authorization: bearer $AT_BEHALF"") );
 
As you can see I added the X-DocuSign-Act-As-User header, providing the email address of User2, and I also added the ""Authorization: bearer 123456789........"" header with $AT_BEHALF being the oAuth token I had previously generated for User2.  
 
Once the request went through I navigated to the URL that was generated, and sure enough it started me in the DocuSign Member Console as User2.
 
Hope this helps...";648;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

We'll be fixing those soon.  
 
Even though it's a different use case, your issue sounds very close to a different one that came in recently.  Instead of uploading the docs, someone was having trouble downloading PDF docs from an existing envelope, and they were experiencing the same exact issue as you (i.e. the number of pages are correct but each page is completely blank). 
 
They seem to have solved this by using a MemoryStream object, please see the following post and see if this might resolve your issue?

The problem with the previous example is that it was trying to write binary data as strings which messes things up.  
 
Things to note with this version is that I left the reading of the http response in XML format but I'm sending a JSON formatted body.  We want to have at least one example in our walkthroughs that show XML parsing, plus Java does not have a built in easy to use JSON reader.  xPath is easy to add and use so that part's the same.  Please note how the outputstream is being written in the second request here.  There's special handling for the PDF bytes...
 
Let us know if these work for you guys.  (Our system does not allow .java attachments so please rename the file to a .java file)

In our system you do NOT need an account if you are just signing documents.  HOWEVER you DO need an account if you are doing more than signing -- i.e. if you are adding/modifying recipient information, adding documents, etc. 
 
So in other words, recipients of type ""Editor"", ""Intermediary"", and ""Manage Envelope"" need to have their own DocuSign account. That's why we'd like to see the JSON that you are sending out...";1162;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

There is a change on demo that should only allow brands to be used on an envelope if the API sender has access to that brand via Groups.  Before, the brand just had to be part of the account.
 
If you have a look at your Preferences -> Groups page, there is now a branding tab in there.  I believe you need to add the API users to that section if you want them to be able to use the brands.  Please let us know if that's the issue...

So there is an account setting that is called ""Allow Markup"" that you can access through your preferences page.  Try logging into your dev account and clicking on your profile icon in the top right of the screen then select Preferences.  On the left hand side of the following screen you'll see a Features page listed.  Click that, and on the following page see if the ""Allow Markup"" checkbox is checked.  If not, try checking it and testing again.
 
If you see it but it's grayed out, then you'll need to contact your account manager or support@docusign.com to have them enable the option for you...

We will be improving our documentation soon regarding this area, but basically the way it works is this:
 
You should not be using the clientUserId unless you are doing Embedded Sending or Embedded Signing.  In our system there are two main methods of initiating signature requests - one is called ""Embedding"" and the other is called ""Remote"".  When you send a signature request to your recipients through email, they are known as Remote recipients.  On the other hand, if you do not want to use email and instead you want to provide a direct URL that your recipients can use to start signing or sending, then you can use Embedding.
 
For Embedding you want to use the clientUserId property, however if you want to use the more common email (or Remote) method then you should not be setting or even including that property in your JSON.  Our system identifies recipients by the combination of recipient name, recipient email, and recipientId.  This is called a remote recipient.  If you use name, email, recipientId, AND clientUserId then the recipient is known as an Embedded or Captive recipient.  
 
Embedded recipients can only access envelopes through URL tokens that expire in 5 minutes.  Remote recipients can only access envelopes through email links that get sent.  
 
For you specific issue, what happens if you don't include the clientUserId property at all? (i.e. don't set it to null, simply delete that whole line so the property is not present)?  This should be easy to test in the API Explorer, just don't set the clientUserId property and let me know your results please.

When using Templates, whether you are using Embedded or Remote recipients, you correlate your recipients to their signature tabs through the templateRoles object in the JSON.  If NOT using templates, then you would need to specify a recipientId for each recipient instead of a roleName.  Since you are trying to use templates you should not need to set the recipientId.
 
Let's see if I can list steps for you to get Embedded Signing to work:
 
1.  Create a template through the DocuSign Admin Console (demo.docusign.net).  Let's say that you create a template with templateId 12345, and that you have one signer role in your template called ""RoleOne"".
2.  On the next page of the template creation add whatever signature and other tabs you want for the ""RoleOne"" template role and SAVE.
3.  Copy the code for Embedded Signing API Walkthrough into your project.  I'm not sure what language you're coding in but the PHP version is probably the fastest and easiest to test.
4.  Enter your credentials at the top of the source file, and copy the templateId (i.e. 12345) into the code as well (near the top).
5.  Change the roleName property of the JSON from ""Signer1"" to ""RoleOne"" (or whatever you named your template role).
6.  RUN the code.  
 
If successful, a URL will be returned that you can navigate to start the signing workflow of the envelope.  If not successful, please post your results here and I'll help you resolve further...

Other integrations, and it sounds like yours falls under this, are more for private use within your company or within your customer base.  
 
If SigFig does not have anyone who has been in contact with DocuSign representatives (other than you contacting us through these forums) then you probably do not have an Account Manager at this point.
 
If this is the case, please send an email to support@docusign.com, include your API Account ID, and ask them to enable ""Embedding functionality"" on your account.

And we need that information in order to know how to proceed. (Our server gets a DocuSign Connect callback, but that takes about 20 seconds; we don't want to leave the user waiting while we wait for the callback.)

First off, I'm not sure why your recipients are all being redirected to the same page.  You should be able to re-direct to different pages based on their actions (i.e. sign, decline to sign, view, etc.)  Have you read the POST Recipient View page of the REST API guide?  It explains the various actions and how to configure URLs for each, see the returnUrl property:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/Content/REST%20API%20References/Post%20Recipient%20View.htm
 
On top of this, you can separately query recipient statuses to see if the signed, declined to sign, etc.  Recipient statuses are similar but slightly different than envelope statuses.  Please see the following for recipient statuses:

  viewRequest.setUserName( Docusign.API_USER_NAME );
sets the username to Justin. Maybe it does. But it does not look like it.  Docusign.API_USER_NAME is very differnet than recipient uer name, the name you claim to be set.  Unless, perhaps you are sending the email to yourself. If so, your code is challanging to read since you are not using Docusign.API_USER_NAME for recipient name.
 
See, we  really can't look over a snippet of code to be very helpfull....in terms of figuring out what your code is actually doing.

I have a question about embedded signing. If I have for example two recipient roles in my envelope like manager and HR in that order, and I present the embedded signing view to the manager to sign, it seems that after the manager completes signing, the envelope isn't sent via email to the HR recipient to sign next. Do I need to also present the embedded view for the HR recipient to sign next?

Everything else works fine, but I am having huge difficulties in trying to set the access code for some of the recipients. I would like to be able to use the template for defining the roles, tabs and documents because their values are constant in all of the requests. However I need to update the name, email address and access code of one of the recipients before sending the envelope. Setting the name and email is not a problem here, but I cannot figure out a way to update the access code for the recipients. Has someone else implemented something like this?

Those are two different aspects about how you want to design your application.  JSON is simply one option you have for the format of the http request and response body, XML is another format option.  So for instance you can code a Java application that sends requests and receives responses in the JSON format.  Or you could have a C# application that sends and receives in XML format.  Same with PHP, Javascript, etc, once you chose your language to code in then it's up to you to specify which format you would like to communicate to the server with.  
 
Once you've decided the format you would like to use you set it through the http request headers.  If you were using Java and the JSON format it would look something like this:
 
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)new URL(url).openConnection();
conn.setRequestProperty(""Content-Type"", ""application/json""); conn.setRequestProperty(""Accept"", ""application/json"");
 
This configures both the request and response bodies to be in JSON format.

So, I changed the content-type from ""image/jpeg"" to ""application/pdf,"" and had Java send a PDF's contents through. The API call again succeeded, but when I go to sign the PDF, the preview of the document is blank. I suspect that the issue is the encoding of the file's contents... but I'm not sure what the ""right' way to send non-plaintext files is. Things that I've tried: Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary, with just the image's contents. Same result; image is scrambled and not visible.Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64, with the image's contents base64-encoded. The base64 string is displayed.Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary, with the image written byte by byte. The character-representation of the bytes are displayed.The java method I'm using:(using org.apache.http.client.* 4.2.1)  private InputStream http_post_form_request( String _url, String _body ) throws IllegalStateException, IOException {
		
		HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
		HttpPost post = new HttpPost( _url );

		post.setHeader( ""Accept"", ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" );
		post.setHeader( ""Content-Type"", ""multipart/form-data; boundary="" + BOUNDARY );
		post.setEntity( new StringEntity( _body ) );
		

		HttpResponse response = client.execute( post );

we have examples in c#, javascript and ruby - but not in Java.
 
Looking at your code, I noticed that you put all the request body into a string buffer - that is what I think causes the error.  
 
When you read a file, open it in binary mode, so you get back a binary buffer/stream.
 
The moment you append that to a string buffer, you are chaning the encoding to utf8. When you send it out, you'll get a blank document.
 
to write the request.. youd need to do the following:
 
client.write(utf8 text)
client.write(byteStream - as a byteStream)
 
so, you have a multi-part - first part JSON, second PDF -
client.Write(firstPart.header + firstPart.body + firstPart.footer) - utf8 encoding
client.write(secondPart.header) - utf8 encoding
client.write(secondPart.body) < dump the binary stream
client.write(secondPart.footer) - utf8 encoding
 
 
Hope this is helpful.";2283;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

This class uses a subclass of MimeMultipart I created called MultipartMessage. I have verified that authentication is working fine as I receive a 200 OK message when I connect to the login_information URL. I first create the MultipartMessage object and add its parts (at this time is only a single part containing the JSON string for the body text).  I am not adding files to the MultipartMessage at this time.  After adding the parts to the MultipartMessage, I then obtain the Content-Type from it since Java auto creates the boundary.  I then pass this value for the Content-Type to the Connection; I substitute the string ""form-data"" for ""mixed"" and keep the boundary information.   The issue is that once I try to create a BufferedReader to read the DocuSign response, I get a 500 error with the following message: {""errorCode"":""UNSPECIFIED_ERROR"",""message"":""Buffer cannot be null.\u000d\u000aParameter name: buffer""} Any idea what this means?

Since I used the following lines to create the MimeBodyPart (where the inputStream is the ByteArray formed from the JSON string):     byte[] messageBytes = getByteArray(messageBody);     InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(messageBytes);    try {          MimeBodyPart mimeBodyPart = this.createMimeBodyPart(inputStream);       ... This essentially placed the body text at the top of the body part.  By calling the setHeaders and setDisposition methods on the MimeBodyPart object placed the Content-Type and Content-Disposition below the body text.  This resulted in the message content part of the MIME looking as follows: ....------=_Part_0_31379709.1355844600678{  ""emailSubject"" : ""This is the subject line text"",  ""emailBlurb"" : ""This is the email blurb text"",  ""status"" : ""created""}Content-Type: application/jsonContent-Disposition: form-data------=_Part_0_31379709.1355844600678--... Obviosuly, we want the Content-Type and Content-Disposition to appear ahead of the JSON body text.  So. instead of using the Java methods to set the headers on the MimeBodyPart, I simply concatenated the Content-Type and Content-Disposition strings to the front of the JSON message string so that these items would appear first. This fixed the issue and the body text now looks like this: Content-Type: application/jsonContent-Disposition: form-data {  ""emailSubject"" : ""This is the subject line text"",  ""emailBlurb"" : ""This is the email blurb text"",  ""status"" : ""created""} Hope this helps -G";1383;N/A;gmagnant;0;answer;N/A

you need to look for server.xml

The envelope is sent but in free-form rather than with signature tabs.  It seems as though the <tabs> element in the XML is being ignored.

What are you supplying for the URLs in your RequestRecipientToken call?  Can you post the XML of the request?  Also to minimize roundtrips it's good to provide the CreateAndSendEnvelope SOAP reqeust.

Next, I took the EnvelopStatus example, generated a JAR from the path src/net/docusign and attempt to connect using the following java code:final String url = ""https://demo.docusign.net/API/3.0"";final DSApiService apiService = newDSApiService(url +""/api.asmx"",accountId,userId,password);final APIServiceSoap port = apiService.getApiService(); This seems to go well, but when i try to ""use"" the connection by executingport.ping();I receive an axis fault telling me: AxisFault faultCode: {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}Client faultSubcode: faultString: One or both of Username and Password are invalid. faultActor: missing in Web.Config faultNode: faultDetail: {missing in Web.Config}ErrorCode:113 {missing in Web.Config}ErrorReason:One or both of Username and Password are invalid.One or both of Username and Password are invalid. at org.apache.axis.message.SOAPFaultBuilder.createFault(SOAPFaultBuilder.java:222) at org.apache.axis.message.SOAPFaultBuilder.endElement(SOAPFaultBuilder.java:129) at org.apache.axis.encoding.DeserializationContext.endElement(DeserializationContext.java:1087) at org.apache.xerces.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.endElement(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLNSDocumentScannerImpl.scanEndElement(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl$FragmentContentDispatcher.dispatch(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.scanDocument(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.parsers.XMLParser.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl.parse(Unknown Source) at org.apache.axis.encoding.DeserializationContext.parse(DeserializationContext.java:227) at org.apache.axis.SOAPPart.getAsSOAPEnvelope(SOAPPart.java:696) at org.apache.axis.Message.getSOAPEnvelope(Message.java:435) at org.apache.axis.handlers.soap.MustUnderstandChecker.invoke(MustUnderstandChecker.java:62) at org.apache.axis.client.AxisClient.invoke(AxisClient.java:206) at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invokeEngine(Call.java:2784) at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2767) at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2443) at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2366) at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:1812) at net.docusign.www.API._3_0.APIServiceSoapStub.ping(APIServiceSoapStub.java:2988) at com.spr.bflow.methods.contracts.DocuSignApiTest.test1(DocuSignApiTest.java:132) at com.spr.bflow.methods.contracts.DocuSignApiTest.run(DocuSignApiTest.java:76) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:585) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:44) at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:15) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:41) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:20) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:28) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:31) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:73) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:46) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:180) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:41) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:173) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:28) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:31) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:220) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit4.runner.JUnit4TestReference.run(JUnit4TestReference.java:45) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.TestExecution.run(TestExecution.java:38) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:460) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:673) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.run(RemoteTestRunner.java:386) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.main(RemoteTestRunner.java:196) What do I miss?

I personally don't like either Axis1 or Axis2 because of the .properties and config files that need to be put into jars and no one knows where to find them.
 
Were you able to create a WAR file that run by just using ANT on command line?
Another difference that might be an issue is that we don't generally use Windows for Java development.  This could be a Axis1/2 + Windows paths issue.
 
My preferred mode of connecting is actually Jax-WS because you can just go ahead and connect without any config files.
If you want I will send you the instructions on how to do that.";1047;N/A;mikebz;0;answer;N/A

I did not create/use the WAR - just the JAR and JUNIT tests - since in the first instance our aim is to post envelopes to DocuSign where the PDF content has been generated out of attributes filled by our users during the workflow . I'm less worried about the config & xml file placement, as we could store them in the CMS as well and access them by code when needed.The initial reason for going for Axix is that we already use axis1.4 in our project for a particular webservice (not DocuSign). For DocuSign integration I'm free to choose the optimal approach, so if that's JAX-WS for you, please do send me the instructions (or attach them to this thread).

The DocuSignAPIDevGuide is extremely unclear as to what exactly should go in that property, or even if it is required.  When I try to use the ACK call, I get ""Unspecified Error"" from the server.  I am using Java to do this part of the integration and have implemented many other client methods on the API.  What I have tried to do is add all the docPdf byte[] data from ExportAuthoritativeCopy into one big byte array, then run an md5sum over that to get the checksumHash. Is that correct, or is there another checksum method needed? Anything I'm missing here?

</soap:Envelope> My gut feeling is that it has little to do with the method of checksum calculation and more to do with the parameter type on the API call.  We use JAX-WS/JAXB to generate the types and client stubs for the WSDL.  In doing so, the AcknowledgeAuthoritativeCopyExport parameter types become in Java (String,String,and byte[]). As you can see in the request XML, the checkSumHash value is a base64 encoded integer value corresponding to the size of the computed hashes.  It should amount to 20, the length of the byte array of the SHA-1 digest.

We sell this solution to Credit Unions and financial institutions, so they want the authoritative copy returned to them so they can put it in cold storage. This may have something to do with that demo account not being set up properly.  I remember there were some problems getting it set up with proper permissions in the first place.

You can turn off the watermarking by disabling the AC in your envelope creation, but it looks like you got a valid business reason to have the electronic original.

Couple of helper functions first:
 
    public static byte[] calculateMD5Sum(byte[] sourceFile) {
        MessageDigest md = null;
        try {
            md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA"");
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            log.error(""Error Getting SHA Algorithm"");
        }
        md.reset();
        md.update(sourceFile);
        return (md.digest());
  }
 
    public static byte[] decrypt(byte[] encryptedFile, String exportString)
            throws Exception {
        byte[] exportKey = exportString.getBytes(""ASCII"");
        byte[] ivKey = exportString.getBytes(""ASCII"");
        SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(exportKey, ""AES"");
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivKey);
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
        byte[] fileByteArrayOutput = cipher.doFinal(encryptedFile);
        return fileByteArrayOutput;
  }
 
Here is the TestCase:
    @Test
    public void gWithdrawAc() throws Exception {
        AuthoritativeCopyExportDocuments export = port.exportAuthoritativeCopy(""E2136F845871496CAA6BB8FECEFFD155"");
 
        ByteArrayOutputStream memory = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        for( DocumentPDF pdf : export.getDocumentPDF() ) {
            memory.write(pdf.getPDFBytes());
        }
 
        byte[] checkSum = GDecrypt.calculateMD5Sum(memory.toByteArray());
 
        System.out.println( ""checksum is:"" + checkSum );
 
        AuthoritativeCopyExportStatus exportAck = port.acknowledgeAuthoritativeCopyExport(""E2136F845871496CAA6BB8FECEFFD155"", 
                                        export.getTransactionId(), checkSum);
 
        for( DocumentPDF pdf : export.getDocumentPDF() ) {
 
            byte[] decrypted = GDecrypt.decrypt(pdf.getPDFBytes(), exportAck.getExportKey());
 
            File file = File.createTempFile(""doc"", "".pdf"");
            System.out.println(""writing file:"" + file.getPath());
            OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file.getPath());
            out.write(decrypted);
            out.close();
        }

Issue occurs when trying to sign embedded documents using Safari v5. When the DocuSign page loads inside the iFrame, an error message - ""Cookies Required."" It then gives instructions on how to enable cookies in Firefox 2.0+, Safari 3.0, and IE 6.0+. Even if the instructions are followed for Safari and customer ensures that cookies are not disabled, the message persists. This problem only arises while trying to view/sign documents in Safari (Mac) - all the other major browsers work fine if instructions are followed.
Safari is providing this to prevent scripted iframe security vector hacks. (Only one that has this turned on by default).
 
A user must manually go to docusign.com first and type the URL in or be redirected to it for the ""Cookie"" to be allowed. 
 
After this, it will work. We do NOT recommend asking the user to set the Safari Privacy setting of Block Cookies: from third parties and advertisers to NEVER as this is too risky.";963;N/A;nicholasareed;0;answer;N/A

re: messages to be displayed to the recipient who needs to attach a document
 
Let me first clarify the use of Document->AttachDescription: it is for documents the sender puts in the envelope. 
 
You have two options for passing notes to the recipient:
1) Add a Recipient -> Note with the information about uploading an attachment. The note is only shown to appropriate recipient.
2) Create a Tab with CustomTabType=Note, and place it by the signer attachment Tab. You'll add instructions in this Note. 
 
re: conditional checkbos
 
In the example bellow, if the checkbox is set, the SignerAttachment will become visible. 
 
 
$attachSignChk = new Tab();
$attachSignChk->Type = TabTypeCode::Custom;
$attachSignChk->CustomTabType = CustomTabType::Checkbox;
$attachSignChk->TabLabel = ""attachSignChk"";

$attachSign = new Tab();
$attachSign->Type = TabTypeCode::SignerAttachment;
$attachSign->ConditionalParentLabel = ""attachSignChk"";
$attachSign->ConditionalParentValue = ""on"";

My understanding is that this functionality may be enabled though the back end.

Here is a link to the Recipient element and it will show that defaultRecipient only applies to CreateEnvelopeFromTemplateAndForms method.
 
Quick summary of what defaultRecipient property is and how it works:
 
The defaultRecipient boolean got introduced to account for the lack of field assignment capability within Adobe forms. Essentially,  If one of the Recipients of a CompositeTemplate is specified as the DefaultRecipient, they will inherit all of the Adobe fields on the form (Data fields and Signature fields). If there are fields that should be assigned to someone other than the DefaultRecipient, those fields can be reassigned to the other Recipient using a Tab override.

I tried to run the copy of LoanCo that I left in my Tomcat webapps, but it failed.  So I set out to (re-)follow the advice (in this thread) that got me working earlier.  1.  I downloaded a fresh copy of the SDK this afternoon, and unzipped it.2.  I logged into my DocuSign developer account (that worked ok), and went to            Account Preferences > Account Administration > API3. Surprisingly, the two Integrator Keys showing there do not match the key I had stored away in my password vault.4.  I tried each integrator key individually (config.properties below): ant clean; ant war; drop in my Tomcat webapps.  I can connect to http://localhost:8080/LoanCo/ easily, and fill out the form.  But when I try to submit,  both fail with:       org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: One or both of Username and Password are invalid.5.  Here's the config.properties (with the last segment of the 2nd integrators key and the account.id obfuscated, as well as the password -- the user.id and password pair are what I used to log in to my account):# Docusign account details#Optional Integrators Key: If key + email are provided this will be used for authentication.docusign.integrators.key=FORM-786e93f9-43e9-4932-bc1d-78a_________docusign.user.id=ken@form-runner.comemail=ken@form-runner.comdocusign.account.id=96a8c913-87af-407e-b6f2-191_________docusign.password=__________# Docusign webservice endpointdocusign.webservice.endpoint=https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx# For X509 authenticationkeystore.file=[REPLACE WITH KEYSTORE FILE]keystore.alias=[REPLACE WITH KEYSTORE ALIAS]keystore.password=[REPLACE WITH KEYSTORE PASS]And below is my docusign-servlet.xml (I haven't changed anything in it).Hope you can help me out.Ken Bowen<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?><!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC ""-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"" ""http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd""><beans>    <bean id=""propertyConfigurer"" class=""org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"">        <property name=""location"">            <value>classpath:config.properties</value>        </property>    </bean>    <!-- Authentication: Integrators Key --><bean id=""apiService"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.APIServiceStubFactory"">        <property name=""integratorsKey"" value=""${docusign.integrators.key}"" />        <property name=""accountId"" value=""${docusign.account.id}"" />        <property name=""password"" value=""${docusign.password}"" />        <property name=""userEmail"" value=""${email}"" />        <property name=""webserviceEndpoint"" value=""${docusign.webservice.endpoint}"" />        <property name=""keystoreFile"" value=""${keystore.file}"" />        <property name=""keystoreAlias"" value=""${keystore.alias}"" />        <property name=""keystorePass"" value=""${keystore.password}"" />    </bean>     <!-- Authentication: X509 with Integrators Key -->    <!--    <bean id=""apiService"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.X509APIServiceStubFactory"">        <property name=""integratorsKey"" value=""${docusign.integrators.key}"" />        <property name=""accountId"" value=""${docusign.account.id}"" />        <property name=""password"" value=""${docusign.password}"" />        <property name=""userEmail"" value=""${email}"" />        <property name=""webserviceEndpoint"" value=""${docusign.webservice.endpoint}"" />        <property name=""keystoreFile"" value=""${keystore.file}"" />        <property name=""keystoreAlias"" value=""${keystore.alias}"" />        <property name=""keystorePass"" value=""${keystore.password}"" />    </bean>    -->     <bean id=""simpleSignController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.SimpleSignAction"">  <property name=""apiService"" ref=""apiService"" />    </bean>    <bean id=""loanApplicationController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.LoanApplicationAction"">  <property name=""apiService"" ref=""apiService"" />    </bean>    <bean id=""signingReturnController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.SigningReturnAction"">        <property name=""apiService"" ref=""apiService"" />    </bean>    <bean id=""viewPdfController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.ViewPdfAction"">  <property name=""apiService"" ref=""apiService"" />    </bean>     <bean id=""wsHeartbeatController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.WebserviceHeartbeatAction"">        <property name=""apiService"" ref=""apiService"" />    </bean>     <bean id=""logDumpController"" class=""net.docusign.loanco.action.LogDumpAction"" />     <bean id=""urlMapping"" class=""org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping"">        <property name=""mappings"">            <props>                <prop key=""/simpleSign.do"">simpleSignController</prop>                <prop key=""/loanApplication.do"">loanApplicationController</prop>                <prop key=""/signingReturn.do"">signingReturnController</prop>                <prop key=""/viewPdf.do"">viewPdfController</prop>                <prop key=""/wsHeartbeat.do"">wsHeartbeatController</prop>                <prop key=""/logDump.do"">logDumpController</prop>            </props>        </property>    </bean>     <bean id=""viewResolver"" class=""org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver"">        <property name=""viewClass""><value>org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView</value></property>        <property name=""prefix""><value>/WEB-INF/jsp/</value></property>        <property name=""suffix""><value>.jsp</value></property>    </bean></beans>";1195;N/A;Runner;0;answer;N/A

I can receive the status updates just fine using a simple capture servlet that I created. For the production interface, I would like to use the Spring MVC framework support for XML marshaling to reduce the complexity of the code that parses the XML. However, I have noticed that the DocuSign Connect service does not set the HTTP request header ""content-type"" to ""application/xml"". This is a problem because Spring MVC uses the content-type header to decide how to marshal the POST body. Since content-type is not set, Spring MVC does not know what to do with the content and so discards it. My question is whether there is some way to get the DocuSign Connect service to set the content-type. If not, could this be added to DocuSign Connect as a feature? This feature would be simple, standards-compliant, and harmless to current applications that don't use it. For example, here are the headers that my capture servlet sees when I use curl to send a DocuSignEnvelopeInformation XML structure. With the content-type header set to ""application/xml"", Spring MVC marshals the XML document correctly: 2013-04-25 12:33:20,161 INFO  (http-8443-6) [com.tc.webservice.docusign.ConnectTestServlet] Request HTTP headers

We're designing a pretty complicated workflow system for them, and their legal department and business decision makers are pretty adamant that the dynamically-generated contract (hence the need for anchor tags) needs to have a calculated date field that is automatically filled in when the LAST person signs (each contract is dynamically generated for 1, 2, or 3 signers); the calculated date field represents the date until which the signers are permitted to cancel the contract.

For your added documents question though, the difference between a ""regular"" signature request and a signature request from a template is that when using the template it sends the document(s) that you've saved with the template.  If you were doing a regular signature request then it would be a multipart/form-data request where you can specify as many documents as you want.  For template signature requests, I'm not sure if you can actually replace the document (it might be possible) but you should be able to add more document(s) to the envelope through the compositeTemplates structure.

I downloaded a couple of them (one simple, one not so much so), and I've had an INVALID_EMAIL_ADDRESS_FOR_RECIPIENT 400 HTTP error code coming back on both of them. I checked to see if it was the template itself, and indeed it was, because I made a new template and uploaded a random PDF, set one signer with ""First Person"" role and one Cc recipient with ""Other Person"" role and the name and email address filled in on Other Person already. From that logic, all I should have to do is make a templateRoles object for the ""First Person"" role and send it off. That worked! So I took a look at the simplest of the two templates I downloaded from our corporate account, and ""YourName"" was saved as the Name value for the signer. Once I got rid of that, the envelope sent with no problem. Took me forever to figure out and it'd be nice if there was a more descriptive error for that. But, here's the real rub: the more complicated template is giving me the same problem. There are two roles that are blank on the email address and name in the routing for the template, so I added those templateRoles objects in my JSON string. I've made sure that no names were filled out other than those whose email address is already pre-filled in the routing, so that's not the issue. I've also tried adding in literally all of the templateRoles, even though many of them were pre-filled in the template definition, which also doesn't work. The email addresses are all valid emails for all recipients, so I know that's not it. What am I not noticing here? The template works fine when we fill out information straight from DocuSign's ""Start a New Envelope"". I would upload the template XML, but unfortunately this is a confidential corporate new-hire packet that I can't leak to a forum. Anybody have any ideas here?";1369;8;lumination;0;question;

} Thanks for your help :) Tried it with a ""dummy"" template that I just uploaded any random PDF to (with no tab definitions or anything of the sort), filled out two roles, one that's a signer with blank name and email, the other that receives a carbon copy with email and name filled out, and all I had to do to get that one to work was fill in the template role (using the same code that generated this request) for the signer with the blank name and email. The role receiving a carbon copy did not need to be explicitly defined and worked just fine. This is a template that we've been using on our corporate account for a while that I simply exported to XML, then imported into my demo account as XML.    Just to verify that any of the templates from our corporate account work, I tried a less complex one and things worked fine, just as expected. I've posted my Java code online, in case you want to have a look at that: http://luminationsolutions.com/docusign_api_code.zip EDIT: I've edited the code for the JSON request from my original reply. When it's output to my console it's not indented and is not pretty at all, and in the course of putting in the indentation so you could read it more easily, I accidentally deleted the colon ("":"") after '""templateRoles""', but it's in the Java code, so I put it back in here.";1326;N/A;lumination;0;answer;N/A

We have an application tied to an API that is sending out a bunch of documents on behalf of a single user account in Human Resources.  The document is routed to two different internal signers designated in the API call, an employee and the manager of the employee.   The manager, who is initiating the workflow by using the app to generate the envelope, would like to know the status of each envelope relating to his/her employees.  We'd like to be able to filter an envelope status request by Recipient or signer so that the manager is only seeing the status of the envelopes that relates to his or her employees.  We'd like to get this information in the API so we can display it within the app that manager is using.  Filtering the request by sender doesn't help us because all of the app's API calls are logged under a single sender. I see that I can do an envelope report within docuSign and filter by ""Recipient"" which does the trick, but we're having trouble replicating that report through the API.

Three things I can think of:
 
1)  Add the manager as a CC recipient, so that each envelope they sign gets added to their inbox and they can then filter either through the Console or though the API.
 
2)  Use SOBO (Send-on-Behalf-Of) functionality through the api so that the requests actually show as coming from a different user.

I don't want to use our interface, and then have to send everyone to the docusign portal to view the status of their envelopes. We are also looking at some other API integrations where it would be helpful to return data by recipient.  For instance, if an account manager sends a document to a customer, when we look up the customer in our application, it would be nice to show the status of the customer's document within the application by pulling envelope statuses by the customer's name through the API.  If I could request an enhancement, it would be to add a ""Recipient"" or ""By Signer"" filter to the API envelope report so that the envelope status data could be integrated into an application without having to store the envelope number in our systems.

On these documents, I have added ""Date Signed tab"" at many places to display Date at the time of signing. I am setting Font as ""Times New Roman"" with Font Size as ""11"" as entire document is in this font with the same font size. However, During reviewing/signing process as well as on completion documents, Font of the Date seems to be different and it clearly stands out from the other text in the document. Can you please let me know why DocuSign is behaving in this manner and please let me know  is there any other setting through API that I am missing.  Thanks,Shriniwas";745;5;shriniwasm;0;question;

Below are some more findings. -  1. The change in font is not just for date fields, but for all fields that Docusign adds during signing phase. 2. The font is Lucida console which as per http://www.docusign.com/dcblog/New-API-Typography is the default font. 3. As per http://www.docusign.com/sites/default/files/Quick%20Start%20-%20Account%20Branding.pdf, we can add the look and feel of any organization's brand to the sending, signing, and email process/phase. The sending, signing, and email phase look and feel is governed by xml resource files as explained in detail in the PDF. But for this we need to check whether the ability to use the resource file option is enabled for our account - HOW DO WE CHECK THAT?? 4. Also to WHAT FIELDS THE BRANDING IS APPLIED...WHETHER IT IS APPLIED TO COMPLETE DOCUMENT OR JUST TO FILEDS THAT ARE PROCESSED BY DOCUSIGN DURING THE SIGNING PHASE??

I found an option at the account level that looks like it might affect the font types and I'm wondering if it needs to be enabled for your account.  Can you please give me your account number so I can look up your account and turn it on if it's not already?

I don't really know how you've setup your project and what classes / methods you have.
 
Are you limited to using the older SOAP protocol or is REST API an option?  REST is encouraged but the choice is yours.
 
If you're stuck with SOAP then have you seen the SOAP SDK up on GitHub?  I'd use that as the base for your project...

Ariba is spend management solution (www.ariba.com) that implements it's own application framework to communicate with DocuSign server. Signature is a specific parameter in hierarchical configuration file called Parameters.table. It is used to define the configuration of the Ariba - Docusign communication framework. This framework communicates to DocuSign servers so as an administrator I do not need to implement the communication just configure it. The problem might also be on the DocuSign side.

We have a tool that allows you to send test requests to the demo server, and even though it's using the REST api it's a way of confirming if your username, password, and integrator key combination is valid.

It's a legacy flag that is not used anymore and it's value is now irrelavent.  So unfortunately we're still at square 1.  
 
At this point I'd call into question the actual credentials you are passing (double checking that the correct credentials are being entered correctly in your code) and also that you are authenticating correctly.  
 
Can you confirm you're following one of the following two authentication methods?..

You need to add a brandId to your API request which tells the system which brand to use since you can save multiple brands.  Otherwise it defaults to the default brand profile of your account.
 
To get this to work you first need to obtain a brand ID of your account.  Make the following call to do this:
 
Get Brand Profiles
 
Once you obtain a valid brand ID, you add to your request body at the root level.  I just tested this out and it worked.

    ""emailSubject"": ""API Signature Request"",
    ""brandId"": ""1a4025e1-2330-461d-936d-d676d949ea02"",
    ""documents"": [
        {

        }
    ],
