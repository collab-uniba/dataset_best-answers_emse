Some are in portrait and some in landscape. The X/Y coordinate system for placing the signature does not work well for these.

Is there ANY consistency with your documents (perhaps even a header or footer bar or Sign Here text) or are they always potentially 100% different from each other?  
 
The reason I ask is that there are two main ways of specifying the location of tabs- absolute positioning or relative positioning.  It seems as though you are found the absolute positioning method, where x and y locations are specified in some unit of measurement (i.e. inches, cms, pixels, etc.)  The other method is called Anchor based tagging or AnchorTabs.  
 
With anchor tagging you can specify the location of tabs with respect to document content.  So for instance, if you had text somewhere in the document that said ""Please Sign Here"" then you could tell the system to place a signature tab (or any tab for that matter) exactly at that location, or N amount of pixels to right, left, down, up from that text, etc.  
 
Often what we see is that people like to place special tags (such as \s1 for instance) in their documents that are the same color as the document background so that you can't see the actual \s1 string but instead you only see the signature tab there.  Furthermore, you can setup these tags at the account level, and have the system automatically place signature/initial/any tabs there as it finds those special strings in your envelopes.  
 
Would something like that work for your needs?

1.  I require the user to not have to sit there an drag custom tags to the document since I am building my own UI. Is there a way to specify through the API that I want these tags applied without user intervention?
Yes, instead of dragging and dropping a Custom Tag that anchors to document content, you can specified anchored tabs through your API call.  Custom Tags apply at the account level, but anchor tags sent through the API only apply to that envelope.  You just need to add the tabs in your request body, then specify their anchor settings.  Check out the Tab Positioning section on this page of the Dev Center:
http://www.docusign.com/developer-center/explore/features/stick-etabs
 
2. How do I specify that my date custom tag should be tied to a certain custom signature tag (also without user intervention)?
I'm not sure what you mean here.  You can anchor Stick-eTabs (aka tabs) to document content, but you can not anchor to other Stick-eTabs.  Is that what you're attempting to do?  If so, sorry but that's not possible...
 
3. How can I specify that the tab should be anchored with an x y offset relative to the imbedded document strings?
Once again, the Stick-eTabs section of the Dev Center explains this.  You just need to set the anchorXOffset and anchorYOffset properties:

What I ment to say is that the date tab automatically sets the date when a certain signature tab is signed. I was under the impression that if you have for example two signature places in a document and one was signed on one date and one on another you would need to tie two separate date tabs to their respective signature tabs so that the two dates would show the different dates of the two signatures. For this to work there would have to be an association between a date tab and a signature tab. But maybe it doesn't work like this. Its not clear.

> Neither.  The date tabs are populated when a particular signer has completed signing, not neccessarily when the entire envelope is complete (although that might be the case if only one signer).  Remember that tabs are specific to recipients not the document itself, so if you have two date tabs configured for one single recipient, then when that recipient completes signing those date tabs will have the same current date.
 
The only way you'll get different dates on multiple date tabs is if they are configured for different recipients, and those recipients complete signing on different days...";763;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

The C# API walkthroughs are just examples to demonstrate functionality and they've been made shorter to make them easier to understand.  In the second step of the Get Documents walkthrough, you'll see that each documents' URI is parsed and used to download the document.  If you look at the full response, there will also be the document name for each document.  You need to parse that JSON (or XML) to get the doc name.
 
For your second question, this is up to you where you want the documents to go.  The C# example simply creates filenames called document_1.pdf, document_2.pdf, etc.  Since no full path is provided, this has the affect of downloading them to the current working directory.  If you want to specify a directory you need to specify the full path of where you want them to go, something like C:\temp\<document_name>

Sorry but I don't believe there's an option to include the envelopeId in the actual email.  In a way that's private data that shouldn't go there anyways.
 
As you're aware the envelopeId is in the signed documents, but it's also in the envelope Certificate PDF, which you can also include in the completed email.  You could write a relatively short amount of code to parse that PDF file for the envelopeId and grab it that way instead of manually...

I know there's no problem with the ioDocs site as I just used it myself, so I'm thinking you're probably passing in the wrong credentials.  First off, you're filling in your email, password, and integrator key at the top of the page, correct?
 
If so, can you verify that you are entering the key correctly and that you're not missing any characters?  It's a long ID string so sometimes we see people not copying the whole thing by mistake, or getting extra characters in there.  
 
And you're positive that you are entering your password correctly, right?";1341;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

The stream comes fine but i have two questions: 1.  All documents seemed to be converted to pdf during upload or during this retrieval call. For example my txt files return as pdf.  Any comments on this?  Will this occur file all file types? 2.  More importantly has anyone devised a way to get the file name from the stream? Or other related properties besides the file size.

Yes all documents (no matter what format) are converted and stored as PDFs in our system- this behavior is by design.  
 
For your second question, yes you can totally get the filename back from doing a GET request to the uri:
 
.../accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/documents
 
 
you'll see a [name] property in the response for each document in the envelope.

When first adding your recipients to the envelope you need to set the name, email, and recipientId properties, but you also need to set the clientUserId for embedding.  Then, when you are requesting the embedded recipient view you need to specifiy the same combination of those 4 properties to correctly identify the recipient.  
 
For instance, when first adding an embedded recipient to the envelope if you give them a clientUserId of 1001, then when you are requesting the recipient view you need to use a clientUserId of 1001 again for them.

I was just debugging the same issue for another customer and found that it came down to, essentially, encoding.  The original code from the DocuSign sample looks like this:
 
string requestBody = ""\r\n\r\n--BOUNDARY\r\n"" + 
					""Content-Type: application/xml\r\n"" + 
						""Content-Disposition: form-data\r\n"" +

						""Content-Disposition: file; filename=\""test_doc.txt\""; documentId=1\r\n"" + 
						""\r\n"" + 
						fileContents + ""\r\n"" + 	// add the file contents
						""--BOUNDARY--\r\n\r\n"";
 
 
request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(baseURL + ""/envelopes"");
                request.Headers.Add(""X-DocuSign-Authentication"", authenticateStr);
                request.ContentType = ""multipart/form-data; boundary=BOUNDARY"";
                request.Accept = ""application/xml"";
                request.ContentLength = requestBody.ToString().Length;
                request.Method = ""POST"";
                // write the body of the request
                byte[] body = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(requestBody.ToString());
                Stream dataStream = request.GetRequestStream();
                dataStream.Write(body, 0, requestBody.ToString().Length);
                dataStream.Close();
 
The change was basically to read the file as a byte stream (without any encoding conversion) and to write this byte stream directly to the request.
 
                byte[] fileContents = File.ReadAllBytes(""./test_doc.pdf"");

                // build the multipart request body

I have a feeling the API Exlporer hasn't been configured properly for this particular API call.  
 
I believe you can still attach documentId and pageNumber properties to the JSON in a request from code and it should not error out- I'm not sure if that will solve your problem though as it looks like something else might be going on here.  AnchorStrings are not separate elements but rather ways of setting the position of tabs instead of using absolute x and y positions.  Looking at the definition of the signHereTab, for instance, it's potential properties are:
 
""signHereTabs"": [{
  ""anchorString"": null,
  ""anchorXOffset"": null,
  ""anchorYOffset"": null,
  ""anchorIgnoreIfNotPresent"": null,
  ""anchorUnits"": null,
  ""conditionalParentLabel"": null,
  ""conditionalParentValue"": null,
  ""documentId"": ""1"",
  ""pageNumber"": ""1"",
  ""recipientId"": ""1"",
  ""templateLocked"": false,
  ""templateRequired"": false,
  ""xPosition"": ""249"",
  ""yPosition"": ""15"",
  ""name"": ""Sign Here"",
  ""optional"": false,
  ""scaleValue"": 1,
  ""tabLabel"": ""Signature 3""
  },
}],
 
As you can see this item can use absolute positioning (by setting the xPosition and yPosition properties) or it can use the anchor properties near the top.  
 
I'm not in a great place to test this now but I can hopefully do so in about a day or so and I'll also inquire about the API Explorer...

I'm a little confused by what you're trying to say about the recipientId property.  I see in your JSON that you have a long GUID that you are using for your recipientId.  Is that system generated or are you creating and assinging that Id?
 
Basically, whatever recipientId you give a recipient when the envelope is created is the one that you have to continually reference throughout the envelope's life cycle.  So if you give a recipientId of ""1001"", then that recipient will always be referred to using recipientId ""1001"" and to add a tab for them you would use the URL:

Let me try to confirm that and log one if necessary, I'll let you know.
 
As far as the recipientIds, I'm still a little confused as to where you are getting this long GUID string to use for them.  I guess it's okay if you want to use such a string, as long as you use the same string to reference the recipientId that you used during envelope creation when you first added the recipient.  The ID that you use is totally up to you, if you want to use something simpler like 1 or 100 then you can, but if you want to continue to use the long strings you're using then go ahead, just make sure you remember them and that they are unique per recipient.";667;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

I see what your talking about.  If i add them via the API I can specify my own IDs.  However what i was orginally doing was creating the draft envelope via code, then adding a recipient via the sandbox dev GUI.  When you do this it auto assigns a GUID.   Just ran a new test but added the recipient via the API and assigned my own recipient id (50). Attempted to add the anchored signing tab again to no avail.  If you guys do determine this is a bug - what is the turn around time on something like this?  I'm hoping fairly quickly sincei would think the ability to add signing tabs is pretty important -- at least for my app it is :-) heh! Thanks, -mike;663;N/A;TuckermanRav;0;answer;N/A

I just finished up a big project and finally have time to return to your issue.  I'll be writing some tests now to see if a bug exists here and will let you know.  Not sure about the turn around time if one is found, at that point you'd need to contact your account manager or support to get updates, however if adding anchored tabs to an draft envelope is broken I'd think it would have a high priority to get fixed.  
 
One question, are you using a template to create your envelope or are you doing a multipart/form-data request without the use of templates?

I'm getting the TAB_PAGE_NUMBER_NOT_SPECIFIED error when trying to add an anchored signature tab to an existing (draft) envelope.  Adding a pageNumber does seem to make the error go away and get the tab added, but I understand that's not a workaround for you as it defeats the whole purpose of anchor tabs which make it so you don't have to specify (or even know) which page numbers they are on.  
 
I'm guessing this bug was introduced recently, and perhaps only in the demo system, as we would have heard a lot more of this if it was in production.  I'm logging a bug as we speak, however as mentioned you'll need to follow up with your account manager or support to track its status.  I only manage the Developer Center and Community Forums and don't have control over bugs.  (I'll PM you the bug # once it's created)

I'm not sure what thread you're referencing as your link is an invalid URL?  
 
Have you seen our SDK for DocuSign Connect using .NET framework?  
https://github.com/docusign/DocuSign-eSignature-SDK/tree/master/MS.NET
 
If you go into the Connect directory you'll see how to set things up.  Some of the most common problems are that you have security that is stopping push notifications from reaching your server such as a firewall or security software.  Other common problems are that your listener is not listening on the correct port number.  
 
Can you confirm some of these basic elements?

First off, to answer your templates question- it should still work.  It doesn't matter if the envelopes are created through templates or not, DocuSign Connect will push all events out that you have enabled.  
 
Let's start with the basics, on the Connect settings page in the console what events are you having pushed from the Connect service?  And which event occurred that produced the partial XML you are observing?  Next, which users are you integrating into the service?  Can you confirm that you have the same uses configured that you are listening for?
 
For testing purposes, I might try enabling ALL the envelope events, ALL the recipient events, and ALL the users in your Connect settings page to see if you get different results.  If not, please let us know which events your listening for, which user, and what the response is.

Is there a way to implement embedded signing without requiring cookies? Since we are using an iframe to load Docusign screen for signature, the cookies set by Docusign becomes third-party cookies. This is less of a problem with intranet use, but our application is public facing, which has to accommodate many users who may have their third-party cookies blocked. On top of this, the ""Cookies Required"" screen is a pop-up. If a user comes to our site with both pop-up and third-party cookies blocked (which is a common setting), they'll see an empty frame where the form should be loading. In some browsers, the users don't even see the ""pop-up blocked"" message and our web application appears to not work correctly. Our management required ease-of-use for our app because many of our public users are not very tech savvy. Any suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks!";598;3;tkdiep;0;question;

The following post has a sample SOAP DocuSignConectUpdate() function written in C# and I see a difference in method signatures.  You are correctly passing in a single parameter (i.e. a DocuSignEnvelopeInformation object), however your function has a void return type whereas the following sample (written by someone on my side) has a return type of string:

Next, I was a little confused when you asked ""is there a way for the first signer to be able to fully edit the document before sending"", can you flesh out that process a little more.  Do you mean that you've created and saved a template using the above function, and the template has one document in it, and now before sending it out you want to make changes to the document?  If so, I'll say that you can not edit the underlying document once it's been uploaded into the DS system, however as you've mentioned you can add tabs such as Data Fields which you can then populate with whatever data you like.

  Fetch (most recent version is Fetch 3.0) is a tool/product DocuSign sells that is designed to... well.. Fetch documents.  :)  It can get documents (either signed documents, or the individual documents from an envelope) as well as data about (and from forms on) documents.  It can collate that data into output summary documents, and push that to a file system.  You can schedule those runs with windows scheduler, and script things.
 
The Product itself is available through your account team, and there is documentation embedded inside the product, but I can link the Documentation here as well:

Other headers can be in XML or JSON format, but that one in particular needs to be XML formatted.  It should always be in this form:
 
<DocuSignCredentials><Username>username</Username><Password>password</Password><IntegratorKey>integratorKey</IntegratorKey></DocuSignCredentials>
 
Other than that though, you can still have a the body of your request (i.e. where you specify all the recipients, tabs, documents, etc.) in JSON format while still passing the authentication header in XML format.  
 
Please give it a try and let us know it that works...

I'm confused about the uniqueness of the X-DocuSign-Authentication header, though.  The next call I am making in my tests - to submit a document for signing - also uses the X-DocuSign-Authentication header (that part, at least, is also pulled from the walkthrough), and though I send the document payload in JSON, it is working just fine.

This would be internal support staff who may need to update an envelope to extend expiration dates or manually void. I added an recipient to the template who can edit the envelope.  The agent needs to be in the same sequence as the signer, otherwise, he has to wait until signing is complete.  But when the two recipients are in the same sequence (1), do I get a status 400 back when creating the envelope. If I change the agent to sequence 2, it works.  But then he doesn't see the envelope until the signer is done with it. What's up?  I thought multiple recipients with the same sequence was a valid operation? I have captured the JSON body of both requests and it is identical.

I've found that we have functionality called SOBO (Send on Behalf Of) which does exactly that- you can send signature requests on behalf of other users in the same account, granted that your account permissions are setup to allow so.  
 
To get it working you'll need to use some of the OAuth calls, which is a recent addition.  More info on making these calls so that you can send on behalf of others call be found in our online REST documentation here:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/Content/OAuth2/Acting%20As%20Other%20Account%20Users.htm

I think that you are not creating the correct request stream.
 
I can verify that the RequestTemplateList function call works. See attachment - it includes both the request and response details. OH - I removed our authentication header since my password is probably not very interesting to you. 
 
So....look at the request stream. Can you do a trace to see what you actually send down the wire? Check out my trace for the request and response format, or go to https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/dsapi.asmx?op=RequestTemplateList for the last say.

Thank you much. That helps a lot.
 
Can you remove the namespace format from the request body? You should have access to the request body, so I imagine that you can remove the namespace format.  If so...please give it a try and let me know.
 
The API definition (https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/dsapi.asmx?op=RequestTemplateList) does not show the namespace format.
 
I'll talk with my engieering team and see if namespaces should be allowed in the request body. It may be working by accident. I'll clarify that.

In our tests, we are able to parse the xml with the example I gave you earlier - by specifying the namespace.
 
It is a bit troubling to see that you are having that error, the namespace ""http://docusign.."" needs to be in quotes; did you use quotes? In your example the quotes are left out.. I wonder if it is just a copy and paste error.

It's not clear if you are planning to embed the signing ceremony in your own Web app (URL and token acquired via RequestRecipientToken) or you need an ""email host"" to receive the email invitation for a remote signer that does not have access to email (In-person Signer).
 
Also, I noticed you are using the same var for assigning the Recipient UserName and Email.  UserName is the name of the person (""first last"" format), while Email needs to be in email format. SignerName is ONLY used for In-person signers, while CaptiveInfo is ONLY applicable to embedded signers.
 
In-person:
- Email and UserName are for the ""host"" that acts as the email surrogate for the actual signer.  This host must have a membership within some account on DocuSign.
- Type is InPersonSigner
- SignerName is for the name of the actual in-person signer.
 
Embedded:
- Email and UserName are for the signer visiting your Web app.
- Type is Signer
- CaptiveInfo.ClientUserId is your ID you use to identify the signer (usually an internal GUID for your customers)

For 2 In-person signers, configure each as type InPersonSigner, specifying the host for Email and UserName.  Set the actual signer's name for SignerName.  Set RoutingOrder to be the same for both.
 
The host will receive 2 emails, one for each signer.  The host should click on the link in one email to perform the signing ceremony for the corresponding In-person signer.  After completing that signing ceremony, the host should then click the link in the other email for the second In-person signer.  Having both open at the same time in the same browser (whether separate windows or browser tabs) will cause problems with the web session, and can only be recommended if using completely different browsers for each, e.g. IE for one signer and Chrome for the other.

If an item fails it will end up on a failure Q and be retried on the next successful publish to that configuration for another envelope 4. Items will be retried for up to 7 days before being cleaned out of the Q. 5. Upon success it will be removed from the retry Q. We have plenty of other successfull events being posted to the listener all day long, but we never see the failure retried after those first two instances (we return HTTP 500 in each case).

Here is more info on how to handle PDF Form Fields.
 
[extract from the documentation referenced by the link]


A DefaultRecipient node has been introduced so that you can specify which recipient the generated tabs from the PDF form are mapped to. You can also set PDF form generated tabs to a recipient other than the DefaultRecipient by specifying the mapping of the tab label that is created to one of the template recipients (see the following example).


You can also use tab label wild carding to map a series of tabs from the PDF form. To use this you must end a tab label with ""\*"" and then the system matches tabs that start with the label (see the following example).


If no DefaultRecipient is specified, tabs must be explicitly mapped to recipients in order to be generated from the form. Unmapped form objects will not be generated into their DocuSign equivalents. (In the case of Signature/Initials, the tabs will be disregarded entirely; in the case of pdf text fields, the field data will be flattened on the Envelope document, but there will not be a corresponding DocuSign data tab.)";409;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

E.g. If an envelope has changed status from sent -> delivered -> completed since the given datetime only the delivered status change will be returned from RequestStatusChanges, I would expect either both changes or at least the latest status change (completed in this case). This issue can easily be replicated: Send an envelope using the Web Console to any email addressOpen and Sign the envelopeCall RequestStatusChanges for the account with a since date a minute before the sent dateOnly the delivered status will be returned for this envelope. Of course, if the service is queried with a 'since' date between the delivered and completed events then completed will be returned. Is this how the API is supposed to work? The documentation says about FilteredEnvelopeStatusChanges ""This is the response for RequestStatusChanges. It returns the current state of the requested envelopes in an array"" (my emphasis).

If you request ""GetStatusChanges"" between 12 and 3PM you should get the Completed Status change at 2PM unless you are filtering wrong.

But if the API has this issue (which it seems to - at least for us) then I afraid our solution might need a huge rethink (maybe even a move to using the Connect API). Polling as we do means if the Delivered and Completed events happen for an envelope between the times we poll we will only be notified of Delivered and as we will ask only for events after the time we just polled in the future we will never be notified of the Completed event. Am I using this API completely wrong? I can't see how it can be working for anyone if you can only call it every 15 minutes or am I meant to use a StatusChangedSince that doesn't change and deal with duplicate notifications over time on my end?

That part works fine, I can make the token, display it in an iframe, sign the document, and get the redirect from the OnSigningComplete URL. However, part of the process also depends on the site getting a request from Docusign Connect (this is mainly from before, when were relying on the emails, so we wouldn't poll for status), and then do some heavier processing once we get that the document has been fully signed. However, I notice that I do not receive a request from Connect when the signing is complete (or at any step along the way, actually), when using embedded signing. The URL is correct on the Connect settings screen, and requests to the URL do reach when using curl and the like. I have logging enabled, and there is nothing in the Logs or Failures tabs on the Connect settings. Is this expected behavior (although I see nothing about it in the docs), some configuration settings I've missed, or an issue? If it's expected, I can work around it by doing a bit more processing than what I'm doing in the page that gets redirected to in the SigningComplete URL, but I would prefer not to make those changes if it's something I'm just not seeing.;266;1;msieker;0;question;

You need to rebuild the Singing project and the Web App LoanCo and restarted the app in via the Debugger after you make the changes and have set a breakpoint at Line 344 in Signing.cs:using (DocuSignWeb.APIServiceWse apiService = CreateApiProxy(accountCredentials))and when it breaks use F10 to step through and make sure your credentials apear in the values. You will get an first chance exception on the next line if it is not set or is incorrect.3. The account information is incorrect, out of order or password is mistyped.If all goes well you will be able to walk through the demo after getting account, making replacements, rebuilding, setting breakpoints, launching debugger for web app, selecting Index.htm, complete the phone and email (as test email account you have so you can see the begin email latter) and press apply. It should break on the breakpoint, you should see the values for you credentials when you hover over the accountCredentials on line 344, press f5 after you press f10 to step a couple lines to continue with the sample and complete signing process as expected within the Sample LoanCo application.Tada!!! your .NET DocuSign LoanCo sample is live with your Demo Account!You can also look in our Demo Account Sent Folder to see the Envelope that was created by the sample.";571;2;sbaker;0;question;

Even if it may happen to be the same, that behavior is not guaranteed.
 
The best way to address scenario is by using custom fileds. This way you don't have to rely on our internal identifiers. 
 
So,
1. at CreateAndSendEnvelope time you set Recipient->CustomFields(array of strings).
2. RequestStatusEx will return the CustomFields for the recipient.
a. if you call RequestStatusEx separately for a number of envelopes, consider a batch call with RequestStatusesEx.
 
 
It goes like this:
 
// this recipient is being passed to CreateAndSendEnvelope()
$r = new Recipient();$customFields = array();
array_push($customFields, ""my custom field 0""); //put your own user identifier/id here array_push($customFields, ""my custom field 1"");
$r->CustomFields = $customFields;
... all other recipeint information
 
 
RequestStatusEx call

                                            [0] => RecipientStatus Object

The problem is, when submitting an envelope this way, we get an error message back (see below), apparently because docusign is looking for more than one document.  My question is: can we tell docusign to ignore the multiple documents in the the template, so that it uses only the single document selected by the user?  On a related topic, sometimes the templates include signature tabs on a page that doesn't exist within the document we are associating with the template.  For example, the template may have a signature tab on page 5, but the selected document only has two pages.  Do tabs need to always be defined using anchor text to handle this scenario?  It comes up because we are working with templates that existed prior to the API integration, and which are anchored to a specific page and pixel location. Thank you very much!

We don't have a remove document(s) or remove recipient(s) API for a template.
 
Ideally, you should create a new template. If not, you can create an envelope from scratch.
 
Also, regarding tabs - if you have tabs that fall onto a page that does not exist, the CreateEnvelope functions will fail. Anchor Tabs are the only way to handle the scenario you described.

Currently, after applying all the templates to the envelope, the system runs through all the field data from each reference and applies the value by label to any tabs with that label across all the templates. When signing however, changing the value in one document should not change the value in the other. 
 
So, FieldData values under a TemplateReference do not apply only to the Template, but instead are applied across the Envelope. We are currently reviewing this design to see if it fits our customer's needs most effectively.";531;N/A;nicholasareed;0;answer;N/A

Note that you don't actually need to be using the same template more than once to find this -- you just need to have the same label across multiple templates. You are correct that it should respect the separation between templates, and it is not currently doing so.
 
I've filed a bug on this issue. In the meanwhile, you can workaround this bug by creating the template x number of times on the server, and naming the data fields differently (say, <label>x). Obviously, this is not an optimal solution as it increases the amount of code written, and we will work on getting a fix out.
 
Again, thanks for bringing this to our attention -- good work!";705;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

Your request looks good. The tabs should show up. Are you verifying by logging in as Recipient 4? 
 
I noticed that initially the RecipientID for the additional tabs was '1', and in your last example, the RecipientId is 4.  Could it be that you are logging as the wrong recipient to verify the additional tab?
 
Bellow is the tab xml I generate, has the same format as your...so it should work.
 
If it does not work, please send me a private message with your soruce file  that generates the whole reqeust since I'd like to run it locally and see what's happening. Alternativley, I can send you the complete source of my test app.

One common issue faced is that ""CustomTabTypeSpecified"" is also required.  With this specified as true the list tab should work.  Note that an example of this in operation using a radio button is in the DocuSign SDK:
 
SendDocument.aspx.: L357-370cs
 
                // Custom radio button tab
                DocuSignAPI.Tab fruitYes = new DocuSignAPI.Tab();
                fruitYes.Type = DocuSignAPI.TabTypeCode.Custom;
                fruitYes.CustomTabType = DocuSignAPI.CustomTabType.Radio;
                fruitYes.CustomTabTypeSpecified = true;
                fruitYes.CustomTabRadioGroupName = ""fruit"";
                fruitYes.TabLabel = ""Yes"";
                fruitYes.Name = ""Yes"";
                fruitYes.Value = ""Yes"";
                fruitYes.DocumentID = ""1"";
                fruitYes.PageNumber = pageThree;
                fruitYes.RecipientID = ""1"";
                fruitYes.XPosition = ""202"";
                fruitYes.YPosition = ""509"";
 
However the SDK doesn't include a drop-down list so here is a more specific example that can be inserted into that section of the SDK:
 
            //Custom list tab
            DocuSignAPI.Tab listTest = new DocuSignAPI.Tab();
            listTest.Type = DocuSignAPI.TabTypeCode.Custom;
            listTest.CustomTabType = DocuSignAPI.CustomTabType.List;
            listTest.CustomTabTypeSpecified = true;
            listTest.CustomTabListItems = ""Option #1;Option #2;Option #3"";
            listTest.CustomTabListValues = ""Value1;Value2;Value3"";
            listTest.DocumentID = ""1"";
            listTest.PageNumber = pageThree;
            listTest.RecipientID = ""1"";
            listTest.XPosition = ""151"";

To make the example straight forward I took all the other tab information out.
 
So, you can see that the TabLabel is the same, and they are separated by the Name identifier. In this particular example, the Female radio button is checked, and you can tell that by the ""X"" within the value tag.
 
So, looking at the TabLabel is not enough. To read the value of a radio button, you need to look at the TabLabel, Name pair.
 
Hope this is helpful.

Web Service Call Trace Files:DocuSign's API relies heavily on the industry standard SOAP to send the XML of API Calls and responses between the API Integration and the DocuSign system. Depending on your platform, the method used to capture and store the XML of the API Call sent to  DocuSign as well as the XML of the response may differ. DocuSign understands that trying to capture and  manage all SOAP traces, both request and response, may requires a robust infrasture. That being the Case, most times, simply having the ability to capture the SOAP traces and turn on then off when necessary, is sufficient. Please note that as part of the Certification process and example of the SOAP traces you could provide must be sent to the API Certifer at DocuSign and must be in an approved format. Account IDAll DocuSign accounts have a unique, 32-character GUID used to identify it. This must be provided for any API Integration issues rasied after the Integration has been certified and migrated successfullyi into Prodcution. Envelope IDAll DocuSign Envelopes are assigned a unique, 32-character GUID used to identify it.  This ID is always included in the SOAP envelope that DocuSign sends back in response to any Create-type API Call the API Integration sends. It is the values for the <EnvelopeID> element in the response XML. This must be provided for any API Integration issues rasied after the Integration has been certified and migrated successfullyi into Prodcution. Number of RetriesThe Number of times you retried resending the failed API Call--with corrections--to DocuSign. Before engaging Support for any API Integration-related issue, you are responsible for testing the issue, trying to identify the cause and possible resolution, and clearly documenting your testing in the e-mail sent to Support requesting assistance. Again, this section simply lists 4 very important items that Support needs to fully research any issue reported on your API Integration to a resolution.

I debugged it all the way through to see if any recipients where being added. It always lists 3 (the correct amount). However it has sent 4 or 5 (duplicate signer and some times a duplicate CC with the blank template). I have had to go in and manually remove the extra ones.

I'm seeing the same problem. If the recipient name has a leading/trailing spacedocusign will create a duplicate recipient2 emails will go outthe link in the first email will 'work'the link in the second email will still allow them to view the doc, but no pre-existing 'tabs' are present (they can add some)the document can't be completed unless they click the first link and sign itWhile I can easily fix the leading space issue, (and I have already), I'm more concerned about what's going on here. Why does this happen?Are there other character encoding/stripping functions going on?If I try a business name like 'Joe & Moe's crabshack <inc>', will the &<> or ', get modified? I'm using the API to create this envelope, and the xml returned to me doesn't indicate that the second recipient was created (though the web page does). If this is intentional, is it documented somewhere? (are clients relying on this behavior, and intentionally sending in recipients with a leading space, so that two emails will go out? - seems unlikely) I still think there is a bug here that needs to be looked at.

Ideally, you want to send over something like this for your tab value:
<![CDATA[line 1
 
line2]]>
But when I try, it keeps escaping the ""<"" and "">"". I'm researching how to go about this, but for now it seems to be an issue with how Visual Studio generates code based upon the endpoint.
 
You can also do some computation on how wide to set the field based upon string length that you are putting in there.
 
If you prepopulate the document, you place signature blocks on it the same way you always do -- through XY coordinates or through anchor text. I'd recommend anchor tabs if you are unsure of the length of your page. You can read about anchor tabs here.";505;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

You need one Signer Attachment Tab per file, so if you need to upload multiple files, you'll have to add multiple tabs.
 
Generally speaking - all input fields need to have a bounded size. 
 
There are a couple of things that you can do: for example, you can create multiple text fields and display them conditionally. Or, if you really need soembody to enter that much information, maybe that data should be transfered via Signer Attachment.
 
 
Conditional tabs may help in your scenario, either making visible additional text fields or signer attachment tabs";403;N/A;vladcretu;1;answer;N/A

My current concerns are centered around the operational aspects of developing and supporting this functionality from the perspective of an application integrator which I haven't seen covered in the online documentation or developer's portals. To start off with, without going into great detail, our company is involved in negotiating a contract with DocuSign to get a discount promotion code that our agents can use when signing up for a DocuSign Individual Professional Edition account.  If all goes well, at that point the individual agent will have a valid Individual DocuSign account that they may begin using immediately. Simultaneously, I have been tasked with developing a web based application that all of the agents will have access to that programmatically prepares the forms (as PDF documents) related to their transactions.  Once those forms have been prepared we would like our application to invoke the DocuSign 'CreateEnvelope' service to upload the documents to the user's 'Draft' folder.  At that point the user can then login to the DocuSign web site, access their 'Draft' folder and continue processing the documents as required. From my understanding, thus far, this feature (when properly configured) can be implemented by using the 'Send on Behalf Of' functionality provided by the DocuSign API.  Currently I have a developer's demo account and a demo 'Integrators Key'.  With those I have been able to invoke the 'CreateEnvelope' service and successfully upload PDF documents to the 'Draft' folder associated with my demo account.   Given these circumstances, my first question becomes, what needs to be done in order for my web application to call the 'CreateEnvelope' service envelope 'On Behalf Of' the agent that is currently using my application? As I stated, In the demo environment I can use my own demo account ID, demo password, and demo Integrators key to successfully invoke the 'CreateEnvelope' service.  Subsequently, in order to invoke the 'Send On Behalf Of' functionality I know that I need to supply either the agent's DocuSign account ID or email address in the SOAP 'UserName' token.  I am just unclear as to what the mechanism is that associates the agent's Individual DocuSign account with my web application account that is providing the 'Send On Behalf' of service. Any assistance that you could provide at this point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Daryl;916;3;dschmoldt;0;question;.NET. API. CreateEnvelope. send on behalf of

The question I have is are all your agents going to be a part of one account OR will they establish their own accounts.

Using SOBO functionality is like being a super user (unix) or an Admin (Windows) on a box.  You still can't reach across accounts because it's a whole different system.  The advantage of using SOBO is that you don't have to type in the password for the folks on your box, but you can't start sending thins on behalf of other users in our system.  That'd be a major security headache.
 
If people plug in their user name and password than they effectively give you a key to their account.  That's an explicit permission for you to act as them.

A couple of things:
 
1) Use our REST API to see how things work. It will map over to the SOAP format. Go to http://iodocs.docusign.com and invoke the functions. Tonight we'll push out an API Walkthrough that will go through this scenario as well.
 
2) It's impossible to tell what's going on without looking at the CreateAndSendEnvelope call. We have the scenario you are working as part of our SDK. Here is the related C# file. 
 
 
The esiest way for us to help you, is if you go and exercise the the functionality thorugh IODocs. If you can get the Recipient View that way, you should be able to get it through SOAP as well.
 
If you have problems, attach the JSON for both Request Signature and Recipient View calls.

My name is Dan Reid, and I am the Director of Product Management in charge of integrations (and a few other miscellaneous things), and I can help. The Connector we ship for Microsoft Dynamics CRM (http://dynamics.pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-US/applications/docusign-electronic-signatures-esignature-... was designed to meet the following goals:1.) It had to be so easy to install that it doesn't take more than a minute or two.2.) It had to immediately work.  Your first send cannot require anyone to talk to anyone, or any sort of manual steps.  It needed to get you right into the sending of a document.  DocuSign is easy, so we want the connectors to be easy and clean as well!3.) We wanted to have it feel like a ""part"" of Dynamics, but not necessarily be 100% native.  Our analogy was the Post office.  I have a mailbox on the side of my house, but the mail gets delivered through another system.  I wanted to be able to LAUNCH the envelope for signature from a screen that is familiar, but I wanted to see the parts which are actually docusign.  With S some other integrations we have done we spent vast amounts of time and money trying to ""smoosh"" the features into the native screens, and people routinely complain about scroll bars, and real estate, etc.  Popping a new tab has worked the best for many of our integrations, so we wanted to try it here as well.Now, the other major thing is about user provisioning (users and stuff).  That is ALWAYS a super hassle when doing integrations (or connectors).  So we wanted to avoid that, and take the burden off the Dynamics admin.  Sure, we support Single Sign on and all that, but that takes work.  And we want to cater to lazy and easy.  SO we made the connector Automatically provision new users as needed.  So if an admin installs the Connector, sets up the account, and a sales person clicks ""Send with Docusign"" from an Opportunity, that person automatically gets an account (user in the admin's acct) set up for him or her.  No need to mess around with users.Hopefully you can see our overall goals here. Now, none of that answers your direct question.  So let me address that. Our Connector is built on the DocuSign open API (the SOAP API actually).  This means that we use all the same calls that are available to any developer who signs up for a developer account on DocuSign.  We didn't use every possible feature available in DocuSign (such as sending data from Dynamics, auto populating fields, or doing any other fancy things).  The reason for this was out of the box usability.  We wanted it to be simple to use, and match the ""lowest common denominator.""  However, if you'd like to build a solution that snaps in to Dynamics and does something specific, you can easily develop such a thing using the APIs. Let's talk more about how to get that going! Firstly, go here:  http://www.docusign.com/developer-center and get a developer account (a log in to Demo.DocuSign.net).  Click the button in the upper right hand of the link above. Then choose whether you will develop against our SOAP API, or our REST API.  The existing connector is built on SOAP, but you don't have to use SOAP if you don't like to build your logic.  Then take a look at our code samples, and examples on that page (or on GITHUB) and you should easily be able to do exactly what you need to do. I hope this helps get you started! -Dan";709;N/A;dreid;0;answer;N/A

Our goal is to find out why the PDFs do not conform and prevent them from progressing to DocuSign for failed signature (informing the uploaded that there is something wrong with the document and not accepting it). Part of our solution is to understand the reason DocuSign failed with the sample document. The filesize was 2MB, so it is not an oversized document. Is there set of requirements that we can code to and identify problematic PDFs? Do we need to interrogate the PDF and check its settings to ensure it does not exceed some allowable setting. I am hoping you can give us explicit PDF parameters that we can check before passing it programmatically to your API interface. Else, is there a downstream workflow function that you can perform on the PDF to reproduce it in an acceptable format? We have > 500 agents with varying hardware that will be developing PDFs that we will need to bring in.  As a solution provider, I need some concrete aspects that I can ensure the documents comply to prior to submitting them to your interface. I can't pass it to the interface and just hope it works, especially since the recommended solution is to experiment with the document until it the interface accepts it. Once we accept the document from the user, we need to be assured that the downstream workflow can handle it. Our only solution now it to allow the PDF to enter our system, submit it to DocuSign, identify the failure, re-print the PDF through Adobe, and resubmit for signature. (An ideal solution would be for Docusign to internally recreate the PDF to known parameters and submit for signature.)

The workflow of my application is as follows: 1. User would select an option where they need to sign a document 2. The document would be created programmatically 3. The user would 'sign' the document 4. We figure out that the document was 'signed' 5.

So, regardless of the number of signers assigned to a document, our system will keep a running copy of the document as it moves through to process completion. Since we will archive a copy of the document on our own servers, it is not necessary to maintain it on yours. Keep in mind that our application will process hundreds of documents in relatively short time frames, so it is not a feasible option to maintain the docusign account manually. regards,Rob;1560;N/A;RobLove;0;answer;N/A

Yes, the answer is that once an Envelope has been Signed and complete, it cannot be voided anymore.

I also have a need to identify the type of each document returned in the envelope.  I see when creating the template on your website that custom fields can be attached to each document and given a value.  This would have been a great way to identify each document, but your API does return this information specific to a document. The only piece of information that is returned in the API that could be used to identify the document is the Type field within the GetListOfEnvelopeDocuments.   How is this field used?

My question is that does docusign pass any user tokens/authentication parameters along with the HTTP request to my connect service? The reason is that our application is more secure and do not want to allow any incoming request without proper authenticate. We will validate the user name and password of every request in our data base before it can be processed. Does docusign support this? If not, how can fulfill my requirement?

The best way to get this done is by using a x509 certificate. In DocuSign Connect setting you have an opiton to enable this setting.

This is a pretty straightforward use of the DocuSign API. There are a few ways you could do this.
 
One way is to create a Template for each possible combination of Documents (if you only have 2 or 3 options, this is feasible), then after their options are chosen you simply use the correct Template. 
 
Another way is to create the PDF dynamically on your side, then send that to DocuSign. 
 
To add parameters to the Document, you will use Tabs. When displaying the Envelope on your website, you'll use Embedded Signing. Finally, you can add your admin as a CC on the document so that they get a completed copy as well.

I think you want to use Shared Tabs when negotiating price. Through the API you specify Tab->SharedTab as True (and you can also require an Initial after markup).

First, the dsapi.asmx endpoint is ONLY for use with HTTP Header authentication.  You need to insert something like this into your HTTP Header:X-docusign-authentication: <DocuSignCredentials><Username>member@account.com</Username><Password>SomeReallyHardPassword</Password><IntegratorKey>FAKE-958469c8-fd5c-4d3d-bea2-53f1234f7f95</IntegratorKey></DocuSignCredentials> If you want to use HTTP Header authentication (here is a link to a blog post on how to do this in .Net:  Create DocuSign HTTP Header Authentication in .NET), then your Service ref is correct.  But, if you don't want to edit code to insert the authentication, delete your Service ref and start over, pointing to the api.asmx endpoint.  The api.asmx is for use ONLY with WS-Security UsernameToken (SOAP Header) authentication.  VS handles this via configuration (app.config or web.config).  You can check your generated config file with the ones in the SDK.   It doesn't sound like you are using SOBO.

Do you mean it works when you create the envelope from scratch using CreateAndSendEnvelope? Or do you mean when using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates?
 
Second, while you can specify exact recipients with a template, if you are going to be switching up the routing order/recipients, you should simply specify a role and routing order when creating the template. That way, you can pair any recipient with the role and routing order you want without predefining the recipient. There are still some instances where predefining the recipient is indicated, but it doesn't sound like your scenario is one of them.

DocuSign Connect - Finer-grained notifications (Recipient events such as Signed) through HTTP calls to your server. http://www.docusign.com/content/restful-way-follow-your-documents.

With Connect you can get immediate notification after Envelope events complete. For example, you can have Connect send the completed Envelope to you after the last person has signed, after each Recipient signs, after somebody cancels signing, etc.

First, you'll need to configure Connect from the DocuSign Console. Log in, then click ""Preferences"" in the top-right. Thenchoose ""Connect"" from the left panel. Go to a custom Connect tab and enter the URL where your SDK sample is located. Turn on loggin from here as well. Don't forget to Save. 
 
Create a new Envelope (just a simple, blank one is fine) with a signing Tab, Recipient, etc. and send the Envelope. Go through the normal signing process. 
 
Now, go back to the Connect preferences and you should be able to see the requests that were made to your server. 
 
On your server, you need to take the POSTed data from Connect, and then do whatever logic you planned on doing for that Envelope. So if you want to, for example, send an SMS after each Recipient signs, you would accept examine the incoming Connect request to figure out who has Signed. 
 
When I'm testing out Connect integrations I will generally log each POST request from Connect to my own database so that I can see what information was POSTed (it is the same information as using EventNotifications).";1308;N/A;nicholasareed;0;answer;N/A

Luckily I have a new machine and installed the SDK from here, built the project, and was able to send an envelope without any changes on my part. The SDK code is working properly.
 
Let's figure out what is happening on your system.
 
Can you successfully run the sample project and see that an envelope is being created and delivered?

You can get to the references.cs file by going to the definition of any DocuSignAPI object - for example,
 DocuSignAPI.APIServiceSoapClient. This will open references.cs.
 
Attach that file.

From Fiddler you can look at the Response/Request body. This is the body that did not make it to the log file completely. 
 
So, you can copy the response and request body from the Fiddler trace to generate the request and response log.
 
Let me know if this will work for you.

You need to enable Fiddler to decrypt https traffic, so that you can see the request/response content.
 
You do that by going to Tools -> Fiddler Options -> HTTPS ->  Decrypt HTTPS traffic.
 
You probably need to re-run the scenario with this option enabled. 
 
An easy way to find the appropriate call trace, is to look under the protocol, since we are using HTTPS in the Web Sessions view.";827;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

There are a number of things for which the logging may not work for you. For example, maybe the maxSizeOfMessageToLog is not large enough for the envelope you are trying to log. So it cuts shorts. 
 
My understanding is that you needed to caputre the response/request body so that you can have the log file necessary to pass certification. With Fiddler, I showed you how to caputure that.
 
Now, if you want to figure out why the log does not work for you... check the value of maxSizeOfMessageToLog. Maybe that's the culprit.";586;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

I have a server based template and some local images that need combining into a final envelope i.e. a PDF with some tags and signature fields first and then additional images that accompany the form that do not require user interaction. I'm relatively new to the DocuSign tool but I've had some success using the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates API call to populate the server based template and I've managed to upload a local image using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms in C# .NET. The now the challenge is to combine my server template with my local images. To summarise, roughly what C# code would you expect to achieve the following: Add a server template with two roles to the envelope.Add x number of local imagesI'm a bit puzzled because I used TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment with CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates but I can't see how to do the equivalent in CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms. I've made a start using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms but I am getting the error 'Tab is placed off of the page. Tab ""TabName"" is located off of page 1.' Any help appreciated, Greg Edit: Following further experiments I've found if I create a second template on the server then I am able to use CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates and change the Document property of the second template to my local jpg. However, as soon as I try to create 'x' number of images I get an 'Unspecified_Error'. I thought it might not like using a template twice so I made 3 purely for images and set their id's in an array (class level and defined on page load). The code I have so far (if  you remove the middle loop then 1 image will upload as required and there are a few test lines kicking around that should be ignored): ---- protected DocuSignAPI.EnvelopeStatus CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates(){DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment[] tfa = new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment[]{new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment(),new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment()};tfa[0].RecipientID = ""1"";tfa[0].RoleName = ""Customer"";tfa[1].RecipientID = ""2"";tfa[1].RoleName = ""Rep"";//DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment[] tfaEmpty = new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment[] { };//Create the template reference from a server-side template IDDocuSignAPI.TemplateReference templateReference = new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReference();//The ID of the template required for the main FORM as created via the DocuSign UItemplateReference.Template = this._templates[0];templateReference.TemplateLocation = DocuSignAPI.TemplateLocationCode.Server;//The form template should be firsttemplateReference.Sequence = ""1"";templateReference.RoleAssignments = tfa;//The name of the folder containing the additional imagesstring targetFolder = ""e33bd7d0-cba8-451f-a952-acfdb2e35dfa"";

I've been assured this is possible so even just objects and required properties would be enough, anything that just shows the steps clearly. It doesn't even need to be based on the above, any code that will: 1. Populate a server template with data2. Add additional pages containing uploaded images.

This manifests itself in how long it takes support issues to be answered. That off my chest, I'd like to share with the developer community how we resolved this internally (through much trial and error). We are a .NET shop, so our resolution may not entirely match what you would need to do (for Java or PHP), but here's what we discovered: --> The main DocuSign api (at https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx) can be added as a Service Reference in Visual Studio 2010. At this point, there appears to be no problem working with the api in this manner (i.e., as a Service Reference). HOWEVER... --> There are apparently authentication issues associated with the Acct Mgmt api (at https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/accountmanagemen t.asmx) if a Service Reference is added to Visual Studio. For this reason, you will need to add this as a Web Reference. Just as important, you will need to create a custom account mgmt proxy class that inherits from AccountManagementService. In this custom class, you will need to override the GetWebRequest method, and in this method you will need to set the Header property X-DocuSign-Authentication. Basically, this approach overall is addressed by DocuSign in a couple of other places (i.e., the need to provide credentials directly in the HTTP Header). DocuSign has a help topic at the following url: http://www.docusign.com/node/2406 . Here, they recommend using a Service Reference, but we instead opted for the Web Reference. Just some additional information for you to consider. There is an attached text file that contains the code for our custom class. You use an instance of this class as your proxy to the Account Mgmt web service.

The way I get this to happen is if I get two recipients - RecipientA, and RecipientB.
 
If RecipientA signs (but not RecipientB) you will see th InProgress watermark when RecipientA views the PDF doc.
 
You can verify the status of the envelope by logging into the Docusign Console and look at the ""Status"" column.

It's  a bit difficult to figure out what's happening. It would help me you can say:
1) what is the state of the envelope: in process or completed?
2) what url are you requesting? sender, recipient..etc
I gathered that when your code runs on your local machine ( meaning that it requests an URL, right?) and you open the URL in an iframe...the behavior is as expected. When you upload your code on your server, and you request the URL and open the url on an iframe, you see the In Process watermark. Right? if so, if you can give me more info about (1) and (2) we can start to figure out what's going on.

The example shows how to create a client proxy - but it does not talk about getting a URL to put into an iframe. This is the document you are referencing, right?
 
URLs used for embedded scenarios are tokens, and there are 4  token: authentication, recipient, sender, and correct. Here you can find documentation about authetication and sender token,  and for anything else you can look at our web api documentation.
 
We also have .net sampe code and you can look a the embedded scenarios to see how to request the tokens.
 
In your case, you need to request an authentication token and launch an iframe with the token (url) given. The authentication token will place you in the docusign console, and if you give it an envelope id as parameters, it will take you to the view of that envelope. If the envelope is complete it will show the signed document.";930;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

My hunch was that you were getting the wrong URL and that the only reason for which it worked on your local machine is that you had cached data. That probably is not the case.

However, since at least one of the applications that will be interfacing with DocuSign is written in unmanaged C++ I will not be able to add the service reference directly, so I'm trying instead of create a separate class library that all of my applications can reference. With that in mind, I've ended up with this code in my application: DocuSignService.DocuSignWS.EnvelopeStatus envStatus = new DocuSignService.DocuSignWS.EnvelopeStatus();
ServiceWrapper client = new ServiceWrapper();

client.UserName = ""firstname.lastname@email.com"";
client.Password = ""mypassword"";
client.IntegratorKey = ""xxxx-1111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"";
                
envStatus = client.CreateAndSendEnvelope(envelope); My DLL is based on this Authentication example, contains a Web Reference to the DocuSign API and the ServiceWrapper class that inherits from APIService:     public class ServiceWrapper : APIService
    {
        private string ID = """";
        private string password = """";
        private string integratorKey = """";

        public string UserName
        {
            get { return ID; }
            set { ID = value; }
        }

        public string Password
        {
            get { return password; }
            set { password = value; }
        }

        public string IntegratorKey
        {
            get { return integratorKey; }
            set { integratorKey = value; }
        }

        protected override System.Net.WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri uri)
        {
            string credentials = """";
            string error = string.Empty;
            System.Net.HttpWebRequest r = base.GetWebRequest(uri) as System.Net.HttpWebRequest;

            credentials = string.Concat(""<DocuSignCredentials><Username>"", this.UserName, ""</Username><Password>"", this.Password);
            credentials = string.Concat(credentials, ""</Password><IntegratorKey>"", this.IntegratorKey, ""</IntegratorKey></DocuSignCredentials>"");

            r.Headers.Add(""X-DocuSign-Authentication"",
                credentials);

            return r;
        }
    } It is the r.Headers.Add() call that is throwing the argument exception with the ""invalid Control characters"" message I'm seeing. Am I misunderstanding what the UserName/Password/IntegratorKey are supposed to be or is there some formatting that I have to perform? I should note that I'm using a Web Reference instead of a Service Reference since I don't want to have to distribute a config file along with a DLL with all my applications (not sure if an external reference would even find a .config file anyway). Perhaps this would be easier if anyone knows how I could encapsulate a Service Reference in a DLL and programatically specify the endpoint without a .config file?";1389;5;amorton;0;question;

Looking at the code I do not see anything obviously wrong, but I'd say there's a good chance that you have some invalid characters in the ""credentials"" string that you are building.  What does that string look like when you print it out?  And does your password or username have any non-standard characters in it, like ones that are not in the UTF-8 set?  You also might want to try one of C#'s encoding functions on your string before using it to see if that makes a difference...

string credentials3 = string.Format(""<IntegratorKey>{0}</IntegratorKey>"", IntegratorKey); The third string.Format() call throws a format exception. This happens whether the key is copied directly out of my DevCenter account or typed manual, and whether it's hardcoded in my application or in my DLL. Keep in mind, when I was previously using a Service Reference I was able to send a document to DocuSign using this key, but I wasn't doing any string formatting with it then. I simply set the APIServiceSoapClient.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName property with the hardcoded string ""[IntegratorKey]andrew.morton@hyland.com"". (Obviously these credentials won't be hardcoded forever, I'm just trying to get something up and running).";1363;N/A;amorton;0;answer;N/A

Probably the best way to troubleshoot this issue would be to capture the actual error that's getting returned when you get the 400 bad request response.  What language are you coding in?  Most languages such as Java and C# for instance will have an error stream that you can read off of the http response to get more specific details about the error.  For example, in Java instead of calling GetInputStream() off of the httpURLConnection object you can call GetErrorStream() and it might return something like ""INVALID_REQUEST_HEADER"" followed by the name of the problematic header for instance.  Let us know when you get a chance...

Are you referring to the page once signing is completed that displays some social link icons (i.e. facebook, twitter) and to the right has the link for users to create a new account?  If so I believe you can prevent that page from displaying through one of the options in your account settings.  Please try logging into your account and in the top right of the page click on your user icon then Preferences.  From there on the left hand side select Features (under the Account Administration section) then find the option that reads ""Signer can create account"".  If you un-check that option it will prevent that page from being displayed...
 
Hope this helps...

This is what I know about interacting Topaz devices:
 
1. your account needs to be enabled to allow recipients to sign with Topaz devices. For this you need to talk with your Account Manager to turn on ""allow signature pad.""
2. the feature only works in IE; meaning that the recipient must use IE to sign the document. DocuSign will recognize that an Topaz device is available and will allow the recipient to sign with it.

Request has 2 documents, so I have 2 CompositeTemplate nodes in the request. One simply has an  InlineTemplate that specifies a recipient and document PDF. 2. The second CompositeTemplate is referencing a ServerTemplate (via template ID), has an InlineTemplate that specifies recipient and has document PDF that I need to be used as the basis, i.e.. I want server side template to be applied on top of the PDF that is sent in the envelope request (as opposed to PDF that was used to create server template). You can see the Xml snippet for this below. 3. My server template has a couple of fields (checkboxes, textbox) that are set to be editable by the recipient AgentReview. 4. I get no errors on envelope submission. 5. When I access the documents as AgentReview role, I see both docs as expected, but I see that the ServerTemplate tabs - checkboxes and a textbox - are applied onto the first document in my envelope and not the 2nd document that was wrapped by CompositeTemplate node that included ServerTemplate.... The fields are correctly fillable by the role, etc., but it appears that the template was simply applied onto the first doc in the envelope. In fact, because my server template is 2 page doc and the first doc in the envelope is 1 page, trying to put a field on 2nd page in server template errors out envelope submission, since (as I understand), the template processing logic fails when it cannot find 2nd document page to apply the server template rules. If I switch the 2 ComPositeTemplates around in the envelope then obviously it appears as if my server template was applied correctly since now the first doc is the PDF that matches the template PDF.  What exactly I am doing wrong? I understand that CompositeTemplate that wraps ServerTemplates, InlineTeplates,a nd Document sort of forms a unit, so I can't figure out how is it that the server template gets applied to a doc from a completely different CompositeTemplate....;520;3;jurgita;0;question;

I'm not very familiar with ASP.net (perhaps someone else can chime in too) but from what I can tell I think you're missing some fundamental parts of your http request.  For starters, what are you trying to test, are you trying to first Login as the IODocs example illustrate?  If so, that would be a GET http request, is that how you are setting up your request in ASP.net?  
 
If you're trying to login you'll need to add a header called ""X-DocuSign-Authentication"" to the GET request, can you confirm you're doing that?  The only header I see you've added is the Content-Type header, which is definitely needed.  Basically you should just follow our examples that are posted on IODocs found here.
 
Another thing I'll mention is that whenever an http request is made there is always a return status code.  You should be able to view the status code that is being returned which will give you more info on what the problem is.  Let us know when you get a chance...

We have certain controls and tabs whos values can be auto-populated from code.  For instance, there are ""Data Field"" tabs that you can add to your documents and have them populate with any string or number you want (up to their corresponding sizes) when the signer views the document.  So for instance if you want someone's name to show up somewhere on each document they need to sign you could easily accomplish this through code using Data Fields and they would not have to repeatedly enter it.
 
The actual signing of a document, however, can not be automated as that would go against some of the digital signing laws that are currently in place.  That part needs to be done by the human as it's part of the signing process along with all the other meta data that is collected when someone signs a doc, but everything else you should be able to automate to your needs.

Yes, it is possible to include multiple templates in a single envelope.  There is information that explains this in the online RestAPI documentation.  Please go here:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/RESTAPIGuide.htm
 
Once on that page select the search tab in the bottom left and search for ""compositeTemplate"".  One result should come up, which is entitled ""Send an Envelope from a Template"".  In there you'll see it explain the compositeTemplate element, which can contain ServerTemplates, InlineTemplates, and others.  All you have to do is contruct a valid request body that conforms to the format that is specified on that page...

So sending an envelope with multiple templates in it would be very similar to Use Case 4 (""Request Signature Document"") on IODocs found here; it would be a multi-part form-data request that you'd create and send and the various boundaries of the request would contain your template definitions and document(s) and recipient(s).  In fact, I think this would be exactly the same as Use Case #4, just the actual content of the body would be bigger and of course your json or xml formatted content will have more in them for the multiple templates.
 
I'm attaching a basic C# application that I've written that accomplishes API Walkthrough (Use Case) #4 for your review, hopefully that helps.  I'm also pasting sample json text of how your multiple templates might look.  I would recommend in your testing that you start small and work you way up (i.e. start with just one compositeTemplate that contains one ServerTemplate, get that working properly, then go from there).  Here's the sample json:
 
{ ""compositeTemplates"": [ { ""serverTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 1, ""templateId"": ""<ENTER TEMPLATE ID #1>"" } ], ""inlineTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 2, ""documents"": [ { ""documentId"": 1, ""name"": ""F1BN-0912 [RC].pdf"", ""transformPdfFields"": false } ], ""recipients"": { ""signers"": [ { ""recipientId"": ""1"", ""roleName"": ""Account Holder 1"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""2"", ""roleName"": ""Account Holder 2"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""3"", ""roleName"": ""Advisor 1"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""4"", ""roleName"": ""Advisor 2"" } ] } } ] }, { ""serverTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 1, ""templateId"": ""<ENTER TEMPLATE ID #2>"" } ], ""inlineTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 2, ""documents"": [ { ""documentId"": 1, ""name"": ""AP-LPL-0912 [RC].pdf"", ""transformPdfFields"": false } ] } ] }, { ""serverTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 1, ""templateId"": ""<ENTER TEMPLATE ID #3>"" } ], ""inlineTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": 2, ""documents"": [ { ""documentId"": 1, ""name"": ""F10-0912 [RC].pdf"", ""transformPdfFields"": false } ], ""recipients"": { ""signers"": [ { ""recipientId"": ""1"", ""roleName"": ""Account Holder 1"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""2"", ""roleName"": ""Account Holder 2"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""3"", ""roleName"": ""Advisor 1"" }, { ""recipientId"": ""4"", ""roleName"": ""Advisor 2"" } ] } } ] } ]}";1204;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

For starters though, have you had a look at our IODocs website yet?  It's geared towards developers like yourself who are just getting started.  There are some API walkthroughs there that have code snippets for very common DocuSign tasks such as Requesting Signatures, Getting Envelope info and status, and uses Embedded Viewing / DocuSign.  The IODocs website can be found here:

And the link for the API Walkthroughs can be found at the top right of the page.

We do not have any plans to retire SOAP and will be continuing support for it moving forward so I'd say whichever API you are more comfortable with go with that one.  In general we encourage people to use the Rest API since SOAP is older, but the decision is yours.  
 
I don't believe we have a side by side comparison sheet for the two APIs but you can compare them through their corresponding online documentations:
REST:  http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/RESTAPIGuide.htm
SOAP:  http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/APIGuide.htm
 
As for getting started, the iodocs website has some useful information.  The API Explorer and API Walkthrough are good starts:

Please have a look at the Embedded Signing process, found here
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/embeddedSigning
 
That process will allow the signers to sign any potential documents that need signing through the Embedded Signing view, which in turn will securely save the documents to the DocuSign database.  Then, if you want copies of the documents saved locally you can downloaded any or all of the documents in a given envelope.  To do so please check out the Get Documents Use case found here:
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/getEnvelopeDocuments
 
The PHP example shows the 3rd step of how to actually download the documents locally (it's currently missing from the JavaScript version but will be added soon).  Please use that as a reference and let us know if you run into any problems...

WIth the DocuSign API you can automate many things during the e-signature process, such as populating form/field data, saving drafts for later completion, adding recipients and documents to envelopes, etc.  
 
However the actual *signing* of document(s) is the one part that the human needs to accomplish by actually clicking in the signature tabs.  In fact, it would _not_ be legal if you were able to automate that part as that would circumvent certain security/legal compliances.  So that's the one part of the process that you can not automate, but most other things you should be able to.

We have tabs that you can add called ""Data Fields"" that you can dynamically populate with an API call, you just need to set it up in the json or xml request body that you create and send.
 
There was a recent post where I help someone get this working.  At first they could not get the fields to populate and after a lot of back and forth we figured out that they were referencing v1 of the api in the url instead of v2 and that's why it wasn't working for them (v1 does not support this).  However if you read through the post you'll see that we pretty go through the whole process of setting up one of the fields and populating it.  Please review this and let me know if it helps:

Please make sure you have the DocuSign Connect check box checked in your admin Console settings.  (The option is located under Preferences - Account Administration -> Features then near the bottom of the page you'll see the checkbox for Connect.)
 
I'm attaching one of our Guides for the Connect service, please review this as it has some valuable information for you :)

http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-NET/DocuSign-Connect-Service-Failed/m-p/11...
 
In there another one of our community managers has posted a sample Page_Load() function in .NET that listens for the Connect Events.  If you are trying to setup a listener this should be helpful.
 
Additionally, you can also request the status of an envelope anytime through the API, to do so please refer this post:

[EDIT]:  Sorry, the above the link shows how to Create an Envelope from a Document, but the idea is the same for Requesting Envelope Status information... you just need to make a different type of request after logging in...

I was able to consistently generate the same error if I log in to the Docusign console (i.e. demo.docusign.net) on one browser window and open an embedded signing screen (our web app) on another browser window in the same computer. If the Docusign console timed out before the web page, the Docusign timeout screen will show in the embedded signing screen. This is tested in IE 8, Windows XP and IE9, Windows 7. However, I was trying to generate the case where I log in to the Docusign console on a different computer and have the embedded signing screen on another computer. I was able to get the Docusign timeout screen to show in the web page once, but wasn't able to consistently recreate the problem.;850;N/A;tkdiep;0;answer;N/A

For instance, when you allocate space for your Recipient you do so with:
 
DSAPI.Recipient
 
On the other hand, when you are assigning the Type for the recipient you do:
 
WindowsApplication1.DSAPI.RecipientTypeCode.Signer
 
Like I said I don't know VB too well so can you explain what the extra WindowsApplication1 qualifier accomplishes?  Is that a reference to the Windows form you've created and you're pulling the Delivery Type from a form field or something of that nature?
 
Have you read the SOAP API Guide regarding the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates() function?  There's actually some sample code on this page which is pretty similar to yours, you might be able to spot a difference I'm hoping.  Note that in the sample code the API objects that are being initialized all have the same qualifier (in this case it's called DocuSignWeb).  Anyways, please review and let us know...

it looks like you are doing all the right things.  My one guess is that possibly you have something going on with the web service config somewhere.  
 
Here are two things that will help:

The only thing remaining is to implement the required error handling and Call Trace Files.  I haven't been able to find any error handling guidelines within the developer documentation.  There's information regarding the types of input requirements and what errors would be flagged when those requirements are not met, however, no information is provided as to the exception types that one should expect to handle when input is invalid, recipients are invalid, the service is unavailable, etc.  The examples in the SDK all show the api calls being wrapped in a handler that catches exceptions of System.Exception.  This is bad practice as the most specific exception types should be handled in a way that is consistant with the kind of recourse that can be accomplished given the exception encountered.  That is to say, if it's a timeout, we might want to try again a few times.  If input is invalid, we should report back to the user and possibly log, if the server is unreachable, we might need to fail out and notify support that the document was not sent correctly and have support manually send out the forms from within docusign.  I mean, if I catch all exceptions from the service and blindly pass the exception message on to the user on a web page, what assurance do I have that the message will be such that it would make sense to an end user of the system and how would I know what recourse to take?  Is there anywhere where I can get this sort of information for a C# .NET integration? Also, I implemented soap call tracing as explained in the Microsoft KB that you guys link to and I am not getting any logs.  Our project is using ASP.NET MVC 3, is there anything different that has to be done to enable the tracing from within this platform?  Have others had difficulty with this and what things did they successfully try to narrow down or remedy the situation? Thanks for your help! Stepen;1052;13;smsenesac;0;question;

The published method for capturing SOAP traces does not work when using the dsapi.asmx endpoint.  This is because it is a Web Service Reference whereas the api.asmx endpoint is a WCF Service Reference.  I just switched to using the api.asmx endpoint as it looks like it would be a lot of work to capture the trace for the other endpoint. Also, something else of note is that the exceptions thrown that I had mentioned earlier as specific to using a Web Service.  If you're using the api.asmx endpoint you will get exceptions of type System.ServiceModel.FaultException when something goes wrong (the only exception type that WCF can send over the wire) and System.ServiceModel.EndpointNotFoundException if the service is unavailable.;580;N/A;smsenesac;0;answer;N/A

In my case, I have two recipients and I have set their routing order on the template to 1 for each of the recipients.  When I look at the order diagram it indicates that the documents should be sent in parallel.  I am using the API to send the template and I am not overriding the order, however, it is always sent to the seller recipient first and the buyer won't get it until the seller is done.  Here's my code for setting up the recipients and assigning them to their roles:             // Create the seller for the agreement.

As of right now, there over 300 employees and close to that number of clients. Each client can also have multiple locations associated with them. The timesheets that we send out are linked to an employee and a particular location for a client. As you can see, this can lead to quite a few documents. Right now, I'm working with test data with just a few employees / clients. These documents are generated programmatically and sent to DocuSign through the API one at a time. This turns out to be rather slow as I have to send a 25KB+ document to DocuSign and wait for a response (we're actually sending two documents, but combined, that's about the size). This is not efficient at all. I did read about a bulk uploader feature in the desktop client (http://community.docusign.com/t5/Ask-A-Support-Question/multiple-recipients/m-p/4735), but I don't think that will allow us the flexibility we currently have for generating the documents.

You could add the most common documents as Templates (through the Console), define the fields that may change depending on client/customer, and add different font styles to have a consistent look and feel throughout the document. 
 
Or, you could use the API to define a Template and then add the dynamic fields.

Safari 5 has always worked for me, so it will be good to determine whether there's an issue with your code, your browser settings, or other.  Here are a couple things I might try as troubleshooting exercises in order to get more info: 1.  Have you tried redirecting to the TokenURL result instead of loading it into an iFrame?  This could illustrate whether the issue is associated to an iFrame.  (BTW, I'm not suggesting that you'll have to build your solution like this; you should definitely be able to embed the signing process in an iFrame...this is how most solutions work, in fact.) 2.  Have you tried to run the demo at www.docusign.com/demo?  This does an embedded signing that redirects to the TokenURL, and it could illustrate if there's somethign awry with your solution (especially if Test #1 above fails).  I'll see if there's a public sample running that embeds the signing in an iFrame so that you can try a working solution from your machine. ~Drew";2453;N/A;oldschool;1;answer;N/A

When redirecting to the TokenURL instead of loading it into an iFrame, the page renders just fine in all browsers, including Safari. I think the problem is some kind of security issue related to cookies coming from pages inside of an iFrame in Safari. I did some research on this but still haven't been able to find a solution. 2. I tried running the demo found on the page you linked to, but it didn't look like it was an embedded signing. There was no iFrame in the source, at least. I tried it in Firefox as well and it rendered the same way. It did work in Safari though, for what it's worth. This is an interesting problem because after doing some more testing, it looks like it only arises on the Mac version of Safari. When I test with the Windows version of Safari, it works fine. We may just end up doing a full redirect instead of using the iFrame just so we don't have to worry about browser issues like this in the future, although we would prefer to use the iFrame because we feel it looks prettier to the end user.;2438;N/A;corpmanagingsys;0;answer;N/A

(Only one that has this turned on by default). A user must manually go to the site first aka type the url in or be redirected to it for the ""Cookie"" to be allowed.  After this, it will work. I would NOT recommend asking the user to set the Safari Privacy setting of Block Cookies: from third parties and advertiesers to NEVER as this is too risky.  I ran into this last year and need to put up a blog post about it :-) Most dev's never see this in unit testing as they have navagated in the URL to the DocuSign test/demo and prod sites and thus the cookie works. Hope this helps and your idea of NOT using a iframe is advisable, but not valid for all scenarios so your may still need to but a ""Do this first"" or other help reference on the screen for users that experience it. There are many test you can do to check for this condition first before the trap is sprung so contact me if you don't find a solution you like.Regardless this will be a support cost to your app if you implement this as an iframe and don't test for the setting and weither cookies from DocuSign are allowed.

JSCRIPT to Test Cookie can be saved at all (DocuSign embedded or inplace signings won't work without it) in ios and/or saffari - this is the BLOCK ALL setting in safari and won't matter what work around you have or try. 2. Have the page logic using a cookie in the parent page to present a  link in the that will direct client sign a document via the brower aka a powerform ""Test"" document before offering a transaction. Then save a cookie as part of the onclick event to show url has been navigated to and always test for that cookie before generating an transaction in a iframe that requires that a cookies can be written.

As I look at the online SOAP documentation here, I see references to functions like CreateAndSendEnvelope() and CreateEnvelope().  I would think that CreateEnvelope() is what you want, although a quick look at the code snippet for it shows a document being added to the envelope.  I'm wondering what would happen if you ran that code but left out the document section?  You might want to try testing that real quick.  Otherwise, if someone else doesn't chime in I'll see if I can maybe test myself sometime tomorrow or the next day...
 
Oh, also check out the SDK located in GitHub, I think there's code snippets that have examples of creating envelopes without any documents in them...

These capabilities are within the CorrectAndResendEnvelope method, which allows for correcting existing recipients and changing some envelope settings but does not provide the features I believe you are seeking.  SOAP also allows you to bring up the Correct UI to perform advanced functions but this may not work since it requires a trained human. Would it be possible to use the REST API which supports adding/deleting both recipients and documents?  If so, see the REST options below and especially the iodocs link which provides a simple web form for sending REST requests.  If not, would it be possible to delay creation of the envelope until all documents and recipient information is available?

That sounds like a firewall might be stopping you, but I'm not sure where or why.  Sometimes it's related to people using the wrong port, but looks like you're using 443 which is correct.  This must be a different issue.  
 
Let me try floating this error message around a little bit and see if anyone knows what's up.  I don't think it's a general issue with the server, or else we would've received about 1000 calls by now...

Finally got this confirmed, yes what you're experiencing is by design.  Since Carbon copy recipients can only view documents and not interact with them (i.e. fill out text fields, sign, etc.) and since custom fields can be made editable, CC recipients do not see those fields.  However, please note that once the documents are completed (signed), if a CC recipient either clicks the link in the automated COMPLETED email or they click the link in the original CCd email they will see the signed document along with any custom fields that were assigned to them.  
 
I just tested this myself using the SOAP API and sure enough my CC recipient did not see the custom fields when the document was still in Progress, however once the document was signed the CC recipient was then able to see the custom fields.

Everything I mentioned in my previous post is correct and how the system works, but that's by default.  I just found out that there is an option that allows those data fields to come through for Carbon Copy recipients.  There is an option in your account settings called ""Display SecureField initial value to all recipients"".  Enabling that option will indeed allow the secure field (i.e. Data Field) values to go through to CC recipients.  
 
However if you do not want it to go through then un-check that option.

I was following the c# code example at http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/getEnvelopeDocuments with poor results.  The PDFs that resulted from it were completely blank. and when I looked at them in a text editor it was clear that I wasn't getting all of the bytes into the file. The Webservice seemed to be working well enough, as I hit the endpoint with the Poster addon to Firefox, and the bytes I retrieved seemed to be complete. After a couple hours of trouble shooting, I decided that it might have something to do with the fact that the example was pulling the bytes as a string, and I wondered if it was tripping over zero bytes or other binary lovelies. So I fixed it by changing this code (starting on line 95 of the example):webResponse = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
sr = new StreamReader(webResponse.GetResponseStream());
responseText = sr.ReadToEnd(); // responseText is a string
using (StreamWriter outfile = new StreamWriter(""document_"" + fileId++ + "".pdf""))
{    // write to local file
    outfile.Write(responseText);
    outfile.Close();
}  To this:using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
using (FileStream outfile = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Create)) {
    response.GetResponseStream().CopyTo(ms);
    if (ms.Length > int.MaxValue) {
        throw new NotSupportedException(""Cannot write a file larger than 2GB."");
    }
    outfile.Write(ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length); // GetBuffer returns the data as a byte[]
}  That enabled me to write the bytes as a byte array, and the PDFs now open with all the expected content.  Has anyone else encountered this?  Did you use a different fix? ~J";705;5;twainj;0;question;

What you want is called ""Embedded"" functionality- you can have Embedded Sending, Emdedded Signing, and Embedded DocuSign.
 
These are all covered by the API Walkthroughs, please see the bottom 3:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthroughs
 
A quick blurb on each:
Embedded Sending - Generates a URL that when navigated to opens up the ""tag and send"" view for a given Envelope. 
 
Emdedded Signing - Generates a URL that when navigated to starts the signing workflow for a given user.  (This is probably what you want)
 
Embedded DocuSign - Opens up the DocuSign member Console (i.e. starts at the begining).  From here users can do anything- send docs, sign docs, change account settings, etc.
 
Hope this helps...

How do I get more information about the specific tabs?  I need an automated way to do this, because the document is generated on the fly. The tab names I use are very specific, identifying the recipient and tab type variation.  So the ""DateSigned"" label could apply to any one of the following.  - [Date.A1] == DateSigned beside Signature RecipientA1 - [InDt.A1] == DateSigned beside Initials for RecipientA1 - [Date.A2] == DateSigned beside Signature RecipientA2 - [InDt.A2] == DateSigned beside Initials for RecipientA2 - [Date.B1] == DateSigned beside Signature RecipientB1 - [InDt.B1] == DateSigned beside Initials for RecipientB1 - [Date.C1] == DateSigned beside Signature RecipientC1 - [InDt.C1] == DateSigned beside Initials for RecipientC1 - [Date.D2] == DateSigned beside Signature RecipientD2 - [InDt.D2] == DateSigned beside Initials for RecipientD2 So my question boils down to two things: - Is there additional information returned when DocuSign encounters an error like this? - How do I get the specific name of the tab rather than simply the tab type?";500;3;kopatterson;0;question;

I'm a little confused on what you're requirements are and what you're trying to accomplish...
 
If you are using the REST API (which we encourage over SOAP) then all you have to do is send your signature, or initial, or date, or whatever tabs you want to include in your request.  Each tab has a name and a type that are specified in your request body (usually JSON format), in the Tabs section.  For instance, something similar to the following would add a signature tab and a text tab (i.e. Data Field which you can dynamically populate text into) to the request:
 
""tabs"": { ""signHereTabs"": [ { ""xPosition"": ""100"", ""yPosition"": ""100"", ""documentId"": ""1"", ""pageNumber"": ""1"" } ], ""textTabs"": [ { ""xPosition"": ""20"", ""yPosition"": ""20"", ""documentId"": ""1"", ""pageNumber"": ""1"", ""tabLabel"": ""TL1"", ""value"": ""ABCDE"" },
 
I encourage you to have a look at some of the tools that were emailed to you a day or two after you created your dev account.  In particular these tools:
 
- API Explorer - you can make test API calls through the webpage without writing a single line of code
- API Walkthroughs - sample code in 5 different languages that's free to copy and use
- Online REST documentation

So we have a form with a line that needs to be signed on. Is it possible to have our form team draw a form field where the signature should go. Give this field a certain name such as ""DOCUSIGN_SIGNATURE"" and save it. When I send it over to DocuSign have them turn that field into a signature tab automatically? Or do I have to find the position of these tabs each time and create the tabs when I build the envelope in .net. Example:Form is created with a form field where they would like the signature to go and name it for example ""DOCUSIGN_SIGNATURE"". I grab this PDF and add it to an evelope like so: Dim envelope As Envelope = New Envelope
        With envelope
            .Subject = ""Signature Request For - "" & docName
            .EmailBlurb = emailText
            .Recipients = recipients.ToArray

        envelope.Documents(0) = doc

Dim status As EnvelopeStatus = proxy.CreateAndSendEnvelope(envelope) DocuSign gets the PDF and turns the fields named ""DOCUSIGN_SIGNATURE"" into Signature Tags?Just trying to see if there are quick ways to implement/maintain this without having to know the x/y coordinates of each signature line on every form.

Have you read about anchor tags yet?  It sounds like those might be a solution for you.  The way anchor tags work is that instead of specifying the actual X and Y positions of your signature tabs their location gets set based on special ""anchor tags"" that are found in the documents.
 
For instance, if you have a document that has the text ""Please sign here:"", you can make an API call that sets the location of signature tabs (and any other type of tab) where ever the text ""Please sign here:"" is found.  Furthermore, you can offset horizontally or vertically from where ever that text is found, so if you find that offsetting by 10 pixels to the right works best then you can easily do that.   
 
Here's the page from the online SOAP guide about anchor tags:
http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/Sending%20Group/Anchor%20Based%20Tagging.htm
 
One of the most common things we see is that people like to use special characters as their anchor tags, maybe something like ""\s1\"" for a signature tab, and what they do is they make the font color the same as the background (usually white) so that it's invisible and all the signers see is the signature tag.  Or if you have common text such as ""Please Sign Here"" you can just use that as an anchor.

How you pull the SQL data into your own application is up to you, but once you have that data you can send it by specifying the tab type and values through your request body.  If you are using the JSON format and you were going to send a ""Data Field"" tab type, then it would look something like this:
 
{""status"": ""sent"",""emailSubject"": ""Testing DocuSign templates:"",""emailBlurb"": ""This comes from Java"",""templateId"": ""<ENTER YOUR TEMPLATE ID>"",""templateRoles"": [{""email"": ""<ENTER EMAIL>"",""name"": ""<ENTER NAME>"",""roleName"": ""<ENTER ROLE>"",""tabs"": {""textTabs"": [{""tabLabel"": ""CompanyName"",""value"": ""My test Company Name""}]}}]}

Yes this functionality should be available in SOAP as well.  What makes you think it's not there?  Just like any other tab in SOAP you can create an ""Anchor Tab Item"" and use it to position your checkbox.  
 
Here is the basic SOAP page regarding tabs:

Yes this is absolutely possible, we have specific functionality setup to do just what you are asking.  They are called ""anchor tabs"" or ""anchor tagging"".  We encourage the use of our newer REST API but either API contains this functionality.  The online API guides explain all of this, do a search for ""anchor"" or see this page for instance:

I believe that all of these three values must match an existing Recipient on the specified Envelope:
 
UserName
Email Address
ClientUserId
 
Can you confirm that the recipient info you are sending in your request matches this info on the existing envelope?  Maybe even try hard-coding them in the request for testing purposes?..

In this case, the Adobe signature fields show and we do not want this as users are not able to use this Adobe feature and we don't want the users to attempt to use this feature.  We want to continue to only generate the documents once, so we're hoping to find a solution.  Is there a way we can hide the fields such that when just viewing the document the Adobe signature fields won't be seen but when we include the document in a DocuSign envelope, the fields will still be found and DocuSign SignHere fields will still be added?

This completed document is available for the user to download regardless of whether or not they choose to e-sign it.  This would be outside of DocuSigns system.  Then, when they decide to e-sign the document, we take the PDF that has already been generated with all their information and we use that in the DocuSign envelope, allowing us to only generate the PDF once. Since we only generate that document one time, the Adobe signature fields exist on the document when the user downloads it (before choosing to esign).  But we don't want the user to think they can use the Adobe signature option, so we'd prefer to not use the Adobe signature fields.  We are using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplateAndForms, which finds our specifically-named Adobe signature fields and places DocuSign sign here fields.   We would rather use a specifically-named textbox or other field to denote where the DocuSign Sign Here fields go so that the users don't see Adobe signature fields.  We also want to continue to not have to give coordinates for the sign here sections, we still would like to be able to name fields with a given naming convention so that the creating process adds the sign here fields.

To do so, there's only one thing you need to do -- you need to specify the FileExtension property on the document object, and set it to the type of file you are using. So, if you are using a .doc, set the FileExtension to ""doc"".
 
For any file format, you need to set the PDFBytes of the document object to the bytes of your file.

It is different than IP Geolocation, and you can read about those differences here.
 
While we do record your IP address, if you let us use geolocation, we gather more accurate data about where you are coming from. This is then incorporated as part of the electronic record, which strengthens the transaction.
 
Different browsers handle geolocation differently. Some will ask you for permission every time, while others will allow you to save your selection and only ask every <x> days.

One thing that may resolve your issue is specifying the UserInfo when creating your filter (for requesting statuses). You specify the account ID, but not necessarily the user's information. This would return all envelopes in the account (not just one particular user's). That doesn't explain why you do not receive any envelopes back from the GetFolderItems call though.

I've had a long discussion about this feature. Here is what is going on.
 
Envelopes that are moved to your Recycle Bin (or Deleted Items if you have the new UI) are removed from your list of folders after a time. However, their official status is not changed to Deleted until two things happen:
 

All people who have pointers to the envelope have put it in their recycle bin
A cleanup job runs

As you can tell, there's typically a period of time where you may have removed an envelope from your folders, but its status is not yet Deleted.
 
We brainstormed one possible solution that you can implement:
 

Query all your folders for envelopes
Request status on those envelopes

What I end up seeing is ALL of the documents deleted or not from that date. And there in lies my problem - i have no means to know what was removed and what was not removed. Now, having said all of this, what I can do is create yet ANOTHER local database of what I have imported, and if an item is already there, I can just skip it. based on what you are telling me, i have to basically do that because the apis do not seem to have any means by which to tell whether I've deleted the envelope from the console or not.";602;N/A;stevere;0;answer;N/A

You do not need to have the creator of an envelope as a recipient in order to be able to call the RequestSenderToken. In fact, you do not need to pass any recipients at all into the envelope prior to calling RequestSenderToken if you do not wish to do so -- you can create them and assign them tabs within the UI.
 
Here's the catch -- in order to be able to have recipients act as captive recipients, their basic recipient structure does need to be created with the API, as that's an API-only feature. So if you have two recipients, A and B, where A needs to use embedded signing, you would need to create at least one recipient (with as much information as you can) through the API, and use the RequestSenderToken method to create the other.
 
I'm not sure why your recipients are on the envelope if you do not want them to sign (signer) or be required to view the documents (certified delivery). Carbon copy recipients just get copies of the documents at a particular stage in the signing cycle. 
 
If you elaborate a bit more about the scenario and problem you are trying to solve, I can steer you better. I will also be able to understand how you are trying to use the Carbon Copy recipient.";187;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

A token (URL that is retrieved by calling RequestRecipientToken) is a one time use, recipient-specific token that expires.
 
You can generate as many tokens as you like, but you can only use each of them once.
 
I think I'm reading your post correctly. This is what I am reading:
 

Create and send envelope with embedded signer (captive recipient)
Request the token for the embedded signer (returns a URL)
Click on that URL (works)
Click on ""Finish Later"" during the signing process
Click on URL again (gives error message)

If this is the case, then there needs to be a step 4.5: Request the token for the embedded signer (returns a URL)
 
Make sense? Let me know if I misinterpreted.

We can't just request a token without a Recipient. Is that correct? I have stepped thru this code over and over. The Recipient object is always the same for both, the first (succesful) request and the subsequents (unsuccesful). It seems like once the signer starts the signing process some sort of flag in your side shuts this signer to pull the document again, regardless of either it finished signing or decided to finish later. It's like a one-chance-to-sign-kiss-goodbye-this-envelope situation. There is ZERO variation in the parameters between the first time we pull the envelope and the rest of the failed attempts because it's a static link with the same parameters. That's why i attached a sample in my previous post of the link i am actually using.

The ProblemWhen the signer is prompted with the ""Adopt Your Signature"" dialog they are able to enter a new signature and initials in the Your Full Name and Your Initials fields. Whatever they put in the Your Full Name field will be saved in the envelope as the UserName for the specified recipient. When you RequestRecipientToken, you must know this UserName as it may be different from when the envelope was originally created. Docusign may have logical reasons for replacing the UserName with the signature name, but at least in our case, the UserName is used by our application independently of the signature name. This obviously causes unexpected behavior because the UserName is being updated outside the system. The major issue we ran into was when a signer would abandon the document after adopting their signature. Since our system didn't know the UserName had changed, RequestRecipientToken would fail. The SolutionWe added functionality to our application to find the current information for the recipient before requesting a token. Doing a RequestStatus will return the current list of recipients. We can then use this information to RequestRecipientToken. An example of our code is below with $recipients being an array of recipients on the envelope. $response = $this->envelope->RequestStatus(array('EnvelopeID'=>$envelopeId));$recipients = $response['RequestStatusResult']['RecipientStatuses']['RecipientStatus']";933;N/A;rguyer;0;answer;N/A

I am not sure what good a trace will do, as I am not experiencing any errors (exceptions or otherwise) My process requires that I control sending invitaions to Recipients through my client application, so I am using the API to program all automated process functions.  In general, I create an Envelope object,  instance and load Recipient objects , instance and load Signing Tabs which are related to AnchorTabs,  instance and load a Document object , and then post the Envelope to the DocuSign service. Eveything proceeds without error, and an EnvelopeID is returned, When I then subsequently rectrieve the Envelope, for the purpose of sending an email invitation to an ordinal recipient , with the intention of making a call to RequestRecipientToken, the Recipient objects in the returned Envelope are devoid of any CaptiveInfo or SignatureInfo  (object values are = Nothing).  Furthermore the RoutingOrder for all recipients is set to a value = 1, despite that specific values were provided in the individual recipient objects when they are originaly created.  Yes, I discovered the property RoutingOrderSpecified =True, but that didnt make a difference.  Again, I am not having an issue with creating the envelope, with all its members,  I am haeving an issue with getting that information back form the DocuSign service. I have attached the first message that was sent in the Create Transaction, the Document bytes were send in the second message in the trace, and there is also a third closing message as well, I will attach those if you require them.

You've posted the request of the CreateEnvelope function, which is great! What is going to be the most helpful is if you can also post the response from DocuSign for that, as well as the request and responses to the Request call that you make.
 
The only thing I can think of offhand to your routing order problem is something is happening between the CreateEnvelope call (which only creates a draft of the envelope) and the sending of that draft. How are you sending the draft? Using SendEnvelope? Or using embedded sending?

Can you try reposting these requests and responses?
 

CreateEnvelope
SendEnvelope
RequestStatus

CreateEnvelope is mainly used to leverage embedded sending. This scenario allows you to create as much of the envelope as you can through code, and then drop the sender into the DocuSign sending UI using RequestSenderToken. Typically, if people are not using embedded sending, they create and send the envelope in one step using CreateAndSendEnvelope.";704;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

I created and Envelope by first assembling the object with two (2) Recipients and one (1) Document. I executed and EnvelopeCreate action through the api,  The Message Trace for this action is attached. In the same code procedure, immediately following the Create action, an EnvelopeSend action was executed via the api. This did not generate a Trace in the log file.  Not sure why. Immediately following execution of the first procedure, a second procedure was called to retrieve the Envelope via the api, so that its content could be inspected. I found that, the Routing Order for each Recipient is recorded properly,  However, the RecipientID values, which were provided as 38 and 39 (respectively) were returned as 1 and 2.  Also, as before, the CaptiveInfo and SignatureInfo elements were not returned (each have a value of Nothing) Onle last thing, when I open the Trace Log file in MS Service Trace Viewer, I receive an Error Report pop-up window, that states, in short:   ""Unexpected End of File . . . the following elements are not closed; PDFBytes,Document,Document . . . RequestEnvelopeResult,RequestEnvelopeResponse, soapBody,soapEnvelope . "" Needless to say, My secod procedure call to retrieve the Envelope did not generate a SoapTrace in the log file either.

While the messages I am sending you are appearently well formed,  I wont rule out the possibily that I have a configuration issue.

As I had mentioned, you will not be getting back a CaptiveInfo object in your response -- you will be getting a ClientUserId without the enclosing CaptiveInfo object. So if you are looking specifically for CaptiveInfo, you will not see that. It sounds like you exceeded your specified file or message size when capturing SOAP traces, so if you increase that limit, you'll be able to capture the trace. Another approach you could do is set a breakpoint after requesting the status, and print the contents of the result. I'm afraid that I cannot give you more insight into what's going wrong with your request call if I cannot see what is being returned from DocuSign.
 
I'm still not clear why you are creating and sending the envelope in two API calls instead of one. Did you look at the CreateAndSendEnvelope function?
 
The service reference approach is the recommended way if you are using the api.asmx endpoint. It shouldn't be a configuration issue -- if it were, you would encounter errors, not incomplete content.";700;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

So far so good:  the EnvelopeStatus field gives us information about the tabs, recipients, and document metadata in the envelope, including the document names and IDs. -- To get to the document bytes, we are using the DocumentPDFs field, also a member of the DocuSitnEnvelopeInformation object.  We can access the document bytes ok. -- The DocumentPDFs each have a document id field, and the DocumentStatus fields also have a document id field. The problem is, the document id field of the DocumentPDFs is always empty, and this element doesn't seem to be defined in the connect xml. The document ids in the DocumentStatuses are populated. The question is, can we rely on the order of the documents in the EnvelopeStatus, and assume that the bytes in DocumentPDFs[ x ] always belong to the corresponding EnvelopeStatus.DocumentStatuses[ x ]? I had assumed this was the case, but now wonder, given that the DocumentPDFs have a document id field in the DocuSignEnvelopeInformation object. Thanks very much for any insights!

Here is the first one: How we are implementing DocuSign is that customers will create ""Templates"" in DocuSign for most of the documents. So they will upload a ""sample"" copy of the document (pdf) in DocuSign and create a template defining recipient roles and signature tags for that document. The template will not have the recipient's name/e-mail address etc. We plan to provide this information while creating the envelope.Now - when we use this template to create an envelope - we use ""CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates"" call and pass in the ""Recipients"" collection. The resultant envelope now has 2 recipients - one from the template and one from the collection of recipients we passed in.How can we update the Recipient(s) already in the Template or remove them and use the ones we provide using the API?";1030;13;ajuneja;0;question;

I also recently helped someone get SOBO working through these forums using OAuth.  Do you have any limitations that would keep you from using OAuth?  If not that's actually the preferred/encouraged method for employing SOBO functionality...
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
In this example User1 will be sending on behalf of User2.  (These are users in the same account and have the proper features enabled in their preferences.  See this page for more info)
 
1)  Obtain a user access token for User1.  To get this do the following:
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/token
 
(headers)Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
(body)grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={email}&password={password}&scope=api
 
When successful you will receive an access_token in the response body, let's say it is the value ""11111"".
 
2)  Obtain a user access token on behalf of User2
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/tokenAuthorization: bearer 11111Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={$emailOnBehalf}&password={password}&scope=api
 
Note that the email used in the line above, $emailOnBehalf, is the email address of User2 (the user will send on behalf of).  Let's say that the access_token that is returned from this call is ""22222"".
 
3)  Send signature request on behalf of User2:
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/accounts/{ACCOUNTID}/envelopesAuthorization: bearer 22222
X-DocuSign-Act-As-User: $emailOnBehalfAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=MYBOUNDARY
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
<request body goes here>
 
In this third call please note the Authorization header and the X-DocuSign-Act-As-User header, which contains the email address for User2.  I just tested this all out and it works...
 
Hope this helps,

I thought I'd spill as much as I possibly can about what I'm attempting again to see if anyone has insight. What I'm trying to solve:I need to be able to add users to my account via the API. I can add users through the dashboard fine, but this is not ideal. I'd like to have it so as new users come to us, we can set them up in docusign automatically. Current Attempts First thing I'm doing in my code is set up the header information just like in my regular Docusign API Call when I'm sending envelopes: Dim dsa As New DocuSignAMAPI
dsa.Username = Constant.Username
dsa.Password = Constant.Password
dsa.IntegratorKey = Constant.IntegratorKey Then I create a member setting object. I've set these to match the sender group permissions if ound in the dash. Dim membersettings As New DocuSignAccountService.MemberSettings

        '''' SET UP PERMISSIONS FOR A MEMBER
        With membersettings
            .CanManageAccount = False

            .EnableSignOnPaperOverride = False
            .EnableSignerAttachments = True

There is a change on demo that should only allow brands to be used on an envelope if the API sender has access to that brand via Groups.  Before, the brand just had to be part of the account.
 
If you have a look at your Preferences -> Groups page, there is now a branding tab in there.  I believe you need to add the API users to that section if you want them to be able to use the brands.  Please let us know if that's the issue...

This is controlled by the recipient object, which means each recipient page in the API guides should describe how to set this up.  There is an member called ""emailNotification"" where you can set the language of the emails.

Having said that though, two solutions that we could come up with are the following:
 
1)  You could have a Required checkbox that says something like ""I have read the document"".  If you set its properties to Required = True then they will not be able to complete the signing of the envelope until the checkbox is checked.  
 
2)  You could host an Embedded Signing session where right before starting the signing flow you navigate your users to this big document you want them to read, and once they are done you navigate them into the signing workflow.  
 
Would one of these options work for your needs?  Of course the required checkbox option is much easier to implement and test but the embedded signing flow would truly force them to read the document (or at least view that page).

I am using visual studio 2010, 4.0 C# web application. I will probably use SOAP The current document management process is now tracked on a spread sheet We need approximately 200 templetes that will generate more than 1000 contracts per year. I was thinking of having the admin staff generate the templetes on Docusign and then download them to a local drive. The admin staff would then select the templetes from the local drive. I would then allow them to pull company information, candidate information, email address and signers from a database and insert them into each of the selected contracts and then send the contracts. Does this approach make sense?Thanks in advance for your replies. Paul;346;2;pdelong;0;question;

Yes this approach makes sense and is easily doable.  One thing I'd like to mention though regarding templates- you can have you admins create the templates and share them, and as long as your users have the proper permissions setup they can use those shared templates and do not have to download them locally.  
 
Each user belongs to a permission profile, and by default there are three profiles (you can add custom ones):  Account Admin, DocuSign Sender, DocuSign viewer.  Under each profile there is a ""Manage Templates"" option which you can set to ""Use"", which means they can use templates they create as well as shared templates that others have created.  Using this method I don't believe they'll have to download the templates locally onto their machines.  And you can add data fields and other tabs to populate any additional data you need in the documents, such as the data you want to pull from your database.  
 
If you're using SOAP then the online SOAP API Guide is a good place to start.
 
Let us know if you have any further questions...

I had responded to the other recent post related to this, please see this posting as it has some useful information:
http://community.docusign.com/t5/DevCenter-Program-Feedback/Template-for-Signatures-and-initials-on-...
 
To answer your question, template matching does not take place when sending requests through the API.  Instead, as you have mentioned, you specify a templateId in your request body and if you want you can add document(s) to the template that have Data Fields tabs which can be populated with different data.  
 
I see you mentioning the API Explorer but have you also seen the API Walkthroughs?  The very first walkthrough shows how to make an API call that uses a template.  The example illustrates how to make the call with a json formatted body; please note that if you are using xml as the format that it would have the same structure of the json body however in xml you need to add a root node (something that the json does not require).  As such, in this case you're root node would be named ""envelopeDefinition"" and would look something like the following (sample Java code):
 
//
// STEP 2 - Send signature request from template 
//
String requestBody = ""<envelopeDefinition xmlns=\""http://www.docusign.com/restapi\"">"" +
""<accountId>"" + accountId + ""</accountId>"" +
""<status>sent</status>"" + 
""<emailSubject>API Call for sending signature request from template</emailSubject>"" +
""<emailBlurb>Sample Email Blurb</emailBlurb>"" + 
""<templateId>"" + templateId + ""</templateId>"" + 
""<templateRoles>"" + 
""<email>"" + email + ""</email>"" +
""<name>Name</name>"" + 
""<roleName>Role</roleName>"" + 
""</templateRoles>"" + 
""</envelopeDefinition>"";
 
There is also the Rest API help page which shows example bodies and what the root nodes for various calls should be:

Hope this helps...

If so, I think that the best solution for you would be not to use a template (since your documents change each time) and instead specify the recipients, documents, and signature requests with an API call.  
 
Templates are more for ""manual"" use in that if you create one through the Console you can easily re-use it in the future either by manually sending through the Console or programatically through the API; however if your document changes each time then perhaps they are not the best solution for you, even though you might be able to hack something up that uses them.  
 
I see you mention that you've reviewed the Walkthroughs but if you have not already please take a look at the 4th walkthrough (Request Signature Document).  This is probably what you want to use, what you want is to make a multi-part form data request where you specifiy the document(s) to send, the recipients, and the signature tabs/locations.  If the locations stay the same you'll only need to specify the location once in the json (or xml) then you can keep re-using that call.  This example shows you exactly how to do this, though it's for one document so if you have multiple docs you'll need to add them in.  Please let me know if this helps or if you have further questions...

In addition, for a single client, the signature field locations will not change from one lease to another.  That being said, we have no idea where those signature fields are as they could be completely different for each client.  So, the individual client will need to define where the signature fields are on each of the documents they upload; hence the creation of the template for the locations of the signatures.

Do they manually do it through the DS Console, or are you looking to automate this part of the process as well through API calls?  
 
After clarifiying that I wanted to mention that anchor strings might be a solution for you.  With anchor strings you can place a string (such as ""\zzz"" for instance) throughout your documents where signers need to sign, and if you send the corresponding json that specifies that anchor tab and a value in your requests for signature calls then you can have Signature tabs show up anywhere where you had an anchor string placed.  Same thing with initial here tabs and others, you could do something like ""\yyy"" where ever you need initial here tabs, and so on.  
 
I think that would solve the problem of you guys having clients who have signature locations that stay the same for a given client, but you guys do not know what those actual locations are.  And what we normally instruct developers to do is make the anchor string font the same color as the background of the document, that way they stay invisible and you only see the signature tabs. 
 
Please see our documentation on anchor tabs and let us know if you think they might work for you or if you have futher questions.  Unfortunately we're still updating our REST API with anchor tab information, but their function is the same as in the SOAP API.  If you go here and in the bottom left go to Search then search for ""anchor"" the top 3 results have some good info:

The example only uses one role while you have two roles, however I'm wondering if you can piece together some of the elements into your request while you debug to try and get resolution.  It looks like you may need to use the inline templates section of the property...

And yes, the demo account is what you use to send documents for signature through the API or Console.  Once you are finished writing your app or website or whatever you are building, you go through our Certification process where your demo account gets turned into a production one.

It's quite possible that's what's causing their issue.
 
The default code of the SOAP SDK (found on GitHub) lists this as the GetFolderList() sample:
 
function getFoldersListSample() {
    global $api;
    global $AccountID;

    // Create the folders filter with an account ID
    $filter = new FoldersFilter();
    $filter->AccountId = $AccountID;

    // Send
    $getFolderListparams = new GetFolderList();
    $getFolderListparams->FoldersFilter = $filter;
    $response = $api->GetFolderList($getFolderListparams);

    return $response;
}
 
As you can see, they are setting the accountId property of the filter, as TuckermanRav pointed out you probably need to do the same.";658;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

In that case, the envelope would be voided and a new one created. The 1st recipient would be notified of the changes.

I'm still not sure when you decide if you need to add a 2nd recipient or not.  Please walk me through step by step so that I can understand your use case.
 
You've stated ""If the first recipient still hasn't signed, then we would add a 2nd recipient to the envelope instead of voiding it.""  As mentioned, if they HAVE signed, then the envelope is complete and you can't add anyone.  If they have NOT signed, you're saying that you then want to add the second recipient.  So why not add both recipients at the time of envelope creation, when you know for sure no one has signed yet??  Especially how you say ""the 2nd recipient can be added at any point before our internal process is complete"" this once again makes me wonder why you can't add both recipients at the time of envelope creation.
 
As mentioned, please clearly state the steps of your process and I can then recommend the best coarse of action for you.  Also, in terms of just adding a new recipient to an envelope after it's been created (as opposed to modifying an existing recipient) I know that this can be done using the REST API but I'm not sure if SOAP has the corresponding functionality.";1033;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

We are using SOAP, but if there's way to add a recipient to an existing envelope, we might need to find a solution using our internal process and applications isntead. The reason we don't know ahead of time if a 2nd recipient will be needed is because the 1st recipient can decide anytime during the process to add a co-borrower to the application. So we can't know ahead of time wether there will be a 2nd recipient. If the 1st recipient decides he wants a co-borrower, then we will need to add the 2nd recipient to the envelope. If the envelope has already been completed, then we will need to void it and create a new envelope with both recipients on it.

Where did you get the ""IgnoreIfNotPresentSpecified"" property from and what's that supposed to do?  I don't see that listed in the SOAP API Guide when I search for it.  I only see the IgnoreIfNotPresent property.
 
Also, I'm not too familiar with Visual Basic, what do the Integer.TryParse() lines do?  It seems you're trimming the word ""Size"" from somewhere and then setting the x and y offsets somehow?
 
Lastly, when you say that you are creating your checkboxes and then you ""name them incrementally for the anchor tab"", does this mean you are trying to use the checkboxes themselves as the anchorStrings?  I wasn't sure that's possible, I thought you could only anchor to actual document content but am not positive on that...";731;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

The TryParse catches any exceptions.What it does is offsets the anchor tab by the size of the font; it is only for positioning. The anchor strings are ""#cbX"", I assign the anchor tabs to the location of ""#cbX"" and change the font color of the ""#cbX"" string to white so it is not seen.

With that said, since you are trying to port the code into Visual Basic we feel that something is being lost in translation somewhere.  Most likely the issue stems from your config file, how does it look when compared to the MS.NET version in GitHub?  Do you have the same http bindings setup?  There are also some important steps taken in BasePage.cs regarding the API proxy, have you incorporated those into your project somewhere as well?
 
Please check/confirm your project config settings and let us know if anything is different.  I'd also be interested to see if you can get the .NET or PHP samples working before you port into VB?
 
Lastly, if you can provide a dump of your outgoing SOAP request that can help us debug as well.  We can't really debug VB code through the forums...";1640;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

This is the project code I used to build the VB project.  I have looked at the config files but I cant see anything that is different.  Do you have a good place I can go to get sample code for the REST API? Maybe I will go that route. Thanks Russ;1608;N/A;russell_bahr;0;answer;N/A

We have several great tools that can help your development in REST and get you going in minutes.
 
Three tools that are very useful for REST are:
 
API Explorer - with this tool you can make any and every api call without writing a single line of code.  Just plug in your creds at the top of the page, select a call, input parameters, and hit the Try It! button.  It shows the request and response headers and bodies which can be very useful (hint: you can use this tool to generate JSON bodies for your requests)
 
API Walkthroughs - These 9 very common use cases, each written in 5 sample languages (sorry no VB unfortunately).  Developers find these extremely useful and usually start their projects by copying the code into their IDEs and modifying from there.
 
REST API Guide - The API guide has lots of useful info, and it even has a comparison page that matches the SOAP methods to their corresponding REST calls.  
 
All of these can be access through our main developers page:

I was talking about how docusign sends emails to the recipients. It turns out I needed to setup the signer for the inperson signer differently. Previously, I had two recipients in the envelope: the host and the signer. The tabs were assigned to the signer. The host had the details of the host and not for the recipient. So, both host and recipient were getting the emails.  What I am doing now. The host recipient carries the security details for the signer. Signer is added as a carbon copy. So, even if the signer gets the email, he can't sign without the host. DocuSign, the way we have to setup the InPerson signer is really weird. Regards,Ashish.;261;N/A;GrayDelegate;0;answer;N/A

Your last question asked if you could first call CreateEnvelope() then SendEnvelope(), and from what I can tell this should work.  Calling CreateEnvelope() returns an envelopeId in the response (I just confirmed that).  You should be able to call that, copy the envelopeId into your DB, then subsequently call SendEnvelope().

By this way it work perfectly with builtin tab type and some some others custom tab type but not work on custom tab type drop down list. Tooltips still show up and value of it is TabLabel. I couldn't chagne value of Tab Label because I need to use it when document complete.(for quering data on our system base on tab label as a key). Althought, I didn't set value for Tab.Name but when I get Enveloper status the Value of Tab.Name was change to  ""CustomTabListItems"". Is this a bug in docusign system? How can i turn off tooltips for all tab via API? <TabStatus>

22/04/2011 12:19:00;false;300;Using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms with radio buttons;http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-NET-READ-ONLY/Using-CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms-with-radio-buttons/td-p/3259;"Hello DocuSign community,
I have been working with a customer who is having some trouble using radio buttons with CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms.  The PDF in question has three radio buttons that are set to the same group, each with a different name.  When this PDF is pulled into DocuSign (manually or via API) the resulting DocuSign tabs have appropriate values.  The goal is to use the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms call to pull the PDFs form fields and to also include an inline template (XML in the SOAP request) to set which radio button is pre-selected.
 
Here is some stripped down code:
 
 
CompositeTemplate template2 = new CompositeTemplate();InlineTemplate inlineTemplate2 = new InlineTemplate();inlineTemplate2.Sequence = ""1"";inlineTemplate2.Envelope = new Envelope();inlineTemplate2.Envelope.Recipients = recipients;inlineTemplate2.Envelope.Recipients[0].DefaultRecipient = true;inlineTemplate2.Envelope.Recipients[0].DefaultRecipientSpecified = true;inlineTemplate2.Envelope.AccountId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""APIAccountId""];Tab tab7 = new Tab();tab7.DocumentID = ""1"";tab7.RecipientID = ""1"";tab7.TabLabel = ""rb1"";tab7.Type = TabTypeCode.Custom;tab7.CustomTabType = CustomTabType.Radio;tab7.Name = ""1"";tab7.Value = ""X"";inlineTemplate2.Envelope.Tabs = new Tab[] { tab7};template2.InlineTemplates = new InlineTemplate[] { inlineTemplate2 };Document document2 = new Document();document2.ID = ""1"";document2.Name = ""TwoPage"";document2.PDFBytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(Server.MapPath(""pdfs/twoPagePdfWithMeta5.pdf""));document2.TransformPdfFields = true;document2.FileExtension = ""pdf"";template2.Document = document2;CompositeTemplate[] compositeTemplate = new CompositeTemplate[] { template2 };APIServiceSoapClient apiService = new APIServiceSoapClient(""APIServiceSoap"", ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""APIUrl""]);apiService.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = ""["" + ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""IntegratorsKey""] + ""]"" + ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""APIUserEmail""];apiService.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""Password""];EnvelopeStatus envStatus = apiService.CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms(envelopeInfo, compositeTemplate, false);string envelopeId = envStatus.EnvelopeID;
 
 
When not trying to set the selected tab, the resulting envelope has three radio buttons like so:
 
rb1 (name=1, value=null)
rb1 (name=2, value=null)
rb1 (name=3, value=null)
 
When using the above code, i would expect this:
 
rb1 (name=1, value=""X"")
rb1 (name=2, value=null)
rb1 (name=3, value=null)
 
However, what is actually observed in the envelope (and can be seen in the envelope XML received from DocuSign Connect) is this:
 
rb1 (name=1, value=null)
rb1 (name=1, value=""X"")
rb1 (name=3, value=null)
 
Note that regardless of the tab's Name value passed to the API, the middle radio button will always be renamed to that name and get the ""X"" value.
 
Has anyone here gotten this to function or know what might be going wrong here?
 
For reference, here is a chunk from the SOAP log:

Currently I have a document template setup with two users and once the first user signs the second user gets an email requesting them to sign.What I would like to happen is that once the first user signs, the document is placed into some kind of holding state. Our application would wait for a specific event and then release the hold on the document so that it gets sent to the second user.I have a couple of thoughts about how to implment this but hopefully there is a better way. Here is the one i'm currently investigating but have run into a problem.* Create a holding role and assign this to a system email account. The application could poll the status of the envelope until it detects that the first user has signed. It can then wait for the event that will either void the envelope or pass it to the second user.PROBLEM: I cannot find a way to delete a recipient from the recipient list (or tell the API that the holding user has completed their task) so that the second user will get the email requesting them to sign.;619;3;charlesevans;0;question;

Unfortunately, there's no way to ""hold"" an envelope in a state without user intervention. So, in order for the envelope to proceed to the second party, the ""holding"" user would need to actually complete an action.
 
If you created the holding role as a CD, then that user would simply need to view the documents in order for the second party to recieve the envelope.
 
If you created the holding role as a Signer, then you could require that user to initial somewhere on the document to complete it and the envelope would go forward.
 
You cannot simulate recipients' actions via the API for security reasons. While you can correct a recipient's information, you cannot delete a recipient.
 
You might explore the CorrectAndResend method. Maybe first set the second party to a holding email address, and then once you are notified in your system that the envelope should be taken out of the holding state, correct it to the actual email address?
 
I don't believe that there's going to be a ""correct"" way to implement this scenario -- it's just going to be a matter of finding a solution that's going to work for you!

However, there is another type that satisfies your requirements: CarbonCopy. CarbonCopy recipients can be placed at any routing order. The CC recipient gets emailed a copy of the envelope as it stands at that point in the signing process. So if you change your CD to a CC recipient, everything should work as expected.

I think it really depends on what type of integration you have. There are a few ways I see people handling credentials (I'm going to talk about credentials in general):
 
 

Give the ability for users to enter, validate and store a specific set of credentials.
Internally mapping users to sets of credentials, so that all the user needs to do is enter his/her username.
Leverage the credential endpoint to retrieve sets of accounts for a particular users via the login method.

I'm sure that you can think of other ways to accomodate multiple accounts. Again, it is very scenario dependent in how you want to handle it.

For documents that require signatures, we're using ServerTemplates and then attaching system-generated application documents.  For documents that don't require signatures (credit score report, for example), we're using only an InlineTemplate with the generated document as an attachment. I've encountered a couple of odd issues while implementing the process. 1) It seems that when using CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms if I include a document without a ServerTemplate, I must add tabs to the document or I get an Unspecified_Error from the API.  To work around this, I'm adding a ""dummy"" tab on documents without ServerTemplates, which the system accepts and discards. 2) Some documents should only be shown to one of the signers on the envelope.  For example, if there are two signers/roles -- Primary and Co-Applicant -- I'll have two credit score disclosures in the envelope (which should only be shown to one party) and on each InlineTemplate's envelope I only specify ONE of the recipients.  However during the signature process all documents in the envelope are visible to all parties.  Is there a way to limit visibility on a particular document in the envelop to just the party that needs to view or sign it?  Why does the API seem to ""roll up"" recipients on each template to the top-level envelope? 3) When calling RequestRecipientToken for the embedded signer, I receive the token from the API and immediately open the URL; however I'm getting a ""Session Ended"" error (""We're sorry, but your session has timed out due to inactivity."").  I've read the default TTL is 5 minutes, but I'm making the request within seconds.  Am I missing something?  I'm currently working in a time zone +2 hours from my account's configured time zone... that wouldn't make sense to me to be the cause but I thought I'd mention it in case. Thank you for any help.

I'll take this step-by-step:
 
 

Can you provide a SOAP trace of the request and response for a CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms that returns that error? That way we can see if there's anything else going on that would cause this issue.
You cannot make documents within an envelope invisible to other signers, just like you cannot prevent someone from looking at a piece of paper in an envelope that you sent to them. You may want to consider whether those should be two separate transactions rather than one. The CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms call is basically a way to layer different sources of information into one envelope. The reason that things ""roll up"" is because you are combining multiple envelopes into one.
The timeout is actually an account level setting. If you PM me your email address that you use for your integration, I can check it for you.";787;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

The business assumed otherwise based on the structure of where recipients go relative to the document/template within the schema.  Perhaps the recipients should be specified higher up in the schema for clarity?  We'll figure out another way to accomplish the requirements. 3) Default is 5 mins, right?  I never changed it.  I will PM you my account email.

Yes, the way (well, an old-school way, at least) to think this method is using transparencies. You've got info on more than one transparency, but only get the full story when you stack them on top of each other. Same goes with this method. Any unresolvable conflicts are determined using a ""last wins"" approach -- same with transparencies. The last transparency laid down will have precedence over the ones under it.

If so, then it sounds like you are doing the right thing.
 
However, because you are receiving that error, it means that somewhere, you request the PDF of an envelope that is in the same state twice. To debug this, audit your API calls and determine where the extra call is made.
 
Please note that this isn't a limit that expires. Once you request the PDF of an envelope that is completed, you can never request it using the API again. To retrieve it later, you will have to go through the console. Therefore, store the PDF as soon as you retrieve it.
 
Again, you can request the PDF of the envelope a total of 9 times:
 
Voided, Created, Deleted, Sent, Delivered, Signed, Completed, Declined and TimedOut
 
but you can only request it once per state.";268;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

Sometime that message is erroneously given for situations when the password or integrator key are incorrect that's why I'd like to take a look at what you are sending.";1846;N/A;mikebz;0;answer;N/A

If you are using the DSAPI, then you are overriding the GetWebRequest method in order to add the custom headers, correct? If so, I think that you could trace the request before it is made. This isn't quite as good as the SOAP trace, but it would be better than nothing. Of course, this does not log the response.

To utilize the send on behalf of functionality while using the DSAPI endpoint, you need to construct the UserName as follows:
 
 
""[<email of user who is being sent on behalf of>;<username of user who is being sent on behalf of>]<email of account doing actual sending>""
 So it will look something like:

Based on your answer, I was able to understand the authentication portion of the Developer's Guide a little better.

Your DSApi is going to be the name of your web reference.
 
Then, to use it, you will create an instance of it like this:
 
 
proxy = new DocuSignDSAPI();
proxy.UserName = _userName;
proxy.Password = _password;
proxy.IntegratorKey = _integratorKey;
 After you've created all the components of your envelope (the elements of which will come off of DSApi), simply pass it to CreateAndSendEnvelope:
 
 
DSApi.EnvelopeStatus status = proxy.CreateAndSendEnvelope(envelope);

two ways you can approach that:
1) you can keep the passwords secret and just keep them in the database that is driving your application
2) you can have one sending account that is sending envelopes on behalf of everyone else.
 
Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks.
#1 - you get to send by using individual members e-mails, but there is a risk that they can reset the password and break your system.  You will have to do some way of detecting changed passwords which is pretty easy since any API call requires a user name and password.  In theory you can run a process once a day and see if anyone has reset their password.
 
#2 - all the envelopes are going to come from one sending account and while it won't be personalized on a per member basis you do have the ultimate control of the password and who sends.

Most of the people I know have launched an amazon EC2 instance and just hosted their ""listener"" there.
 
There are a lot of hoops between us and your laptop and debugging a bunch of forwarding is tiresome.  I think an Amazon micro instance is $.02 an hour or something like that.

You cannot skip sending the envelope and go straight into signing. To be able to start signing directly from sending, the recipient needs to also be the sender -- so that approach won't work.
 
However, you might want to explore the Agent role. This allows a recipient (maybe the sender) to designate the signers after the envelope has been sent. You can read more about the Agent role here. The agent would then name the recipients, and you could utilize in-person signing for the signers.
 
However, maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by ""suppressing the send"" -- do you mean suppressing the invitation email?";275;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/Content/REST%20API%20References/Send%20an%20Envelope%20from%2...

            ]
        },
        {
            ""serverTemplates"": [ ...
 
But instead it needs to be like this:
 
""serverTemplates"":[
        {
          ""sequence"":""String content"",
          ""templateId"":""String content""
        },

          ""sequence"":""String content"",
          ""templateId"":""String content""
        }
      ],
 
The serverTemplates section is an array, which means it's a comma separated list of elements.  Please read the guide for more info...

I see two templates in the JSON you've provided here, the first is templateId a4cfcd16-3a9b-4ee7-b32a-e6632afb671d and the second is in the compositeTemplates section and it has ID 3213b86b-3414-49f4-b8d9-cc563293a3db.
 
If you login to the Console, go to the Manage section and find these templates in the myTemplates folder, what do they look like? Do each of them contain tabs??  And does the first one use your first document and the second one use the other document?  If not, and one of the templates is referencing a different document, then that's probably why your second document is showing up without any documents.  
 
If both of them DO reference the correct documents, and you are referencing the correct templateIds in your JSON, then you should look at the templateRoles.  Are you roles setup correctly for the recipients?  Do they have tabs setup?";1169;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

- Try using a sequence value = 2 instead of 1 for the compositeTemplate.  
- Try changing the roleName of one of the Templates.  You've mentioned that they are both ""Client"", just as a test what happens if one is Client and one is Client2 or something similar?
 
And I see that you say the first template uses the first document and the second template uses the second document, but can you also confirm that each individual template has tabs added to them when you view them in the Console?

However, I was able to find a sample request that uses 2 templates using the composite templates structure.  The example only uses one role but it applies two templates to the same envelope using the composite templates structure, so I'm wondering if you can piece together some of the elements into your request while you debug to try and get resolution.  It looks like you may need to use the inline templates section of the property to specify the roles...
 
Sorry about the format as this forum does not take tab characters when copy pasting:

Here is an example that uses two templates. The result is two documents in the envelope (one from each template) both withtest@email.com (fake email address) assigned to the Signer1 role.

        }
      ],

        {

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  I will forward this issue on to development by creating a bug.  To best address this issue we'll need as much info as possible. 
 
For starters, please give me 3 of your old templates (the ones generating errors) so I can attach those samples to the bug.  Next, I'll see you mention that these were created around 6 months ago- that's helpful but do you know approximately when they were last working?  
 
Lastly, do you have a production account with us?  (i.e. can you sign in to www.docusign.net)?  If so, I'm curious if you get the error when you try upload one of these templates into there?)  That would give us some good info.
 
In terms of your direct questions:
1)  Verification of the bug by development is how we can verify this issue.
2)  I don't believe there's any conversion tool we can use on your older templates, especially without knowing what the exact problem is yet.  However once the bug is fixed you shouldn't have to do anything.  
3)  We are extremely careful with the production system, and I have never seen any such issues in production.  There are numerous staging areas (such as demo) that help identify these issues well before they can make it into production, plus production has extra levels of testing around it.  Additionally, everything is backed up in our system in case anything did go wrong.";486;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Sorry but you'll have to perform that logic on your end - the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms() function does not check what type of recipients have been added unfortunately.  
 
The demo accounts have enterprise level functionality enabled on them so that you can test such features to see how they work.

I think the tabs will be part of the response that is returned, here's the sample code from that page:
 
// Create and send envelope as shown in linked code
DocuSignWeb.EnvelopeStatus status = <create and send envelope>;
 
// Call to request the envelope with the envelope's ID
DocuSignWeb.Envelope returnEnvelope = _apiClient.RequestEnvelope(status.EnvelopeID, false);

Assuming you've already created your free developer account, login to it, then in the top right of the screen go click your profile icon then Preferences.  Scroll all the way down on the following page and on the left hand side you'll see a link for API.  Click that, and you generate your integrator key on that screen.
 
Also, have you see all of our REST tools to help your development?  We have some great tools:
 
API Explorer - You can make test API calls using REST without writing any code!  And you can see the request headers and bodies and the responses as well for each call. 
 
API Walkthroughs - This demonstrates 9 of the most common use cases of the API, and for each use case it has 5 sample languages for you to copy and run.  You just need to enter your credentials at the top.
 
REST API Guide - The documentation for the API.

I'm testing with a PDF doc, not sure if that's what's causing our different results, but I'm attaching the test code I just created for this.  It's PHP not C#, but PHP can be run on Mac or Windows so you should be able to test this easily if you like.  
 
If you copy a test PDF into the same directory as the source file and call it ""document.pdf"", and enter your credentials at the top of the file, you should be able to test quickly.

First off, I always see the UI issue in that it doesn't display the recipient in the TO field but they are indeed there.  I think we all agree that is a UI issue that's bothersome but not a show stopper.  
 
For the main bug that you are seeing, I'm able to reproduce on some of my tries.  Sometimes my anchored tabs show up, sometimes they do not.  It's almost 50/50 for me.  And I'm following your steps exactly, first creating a draft envelope, then adding a recipient, then adding anchored tabs for that recipient.  
 
I'm trying to narrow down a little further if possible but it looks like I'll need to log a bug for this.  I'm wondering if I'm maybe getting mixed results because it finds my anchor text ""Signature"" more than once so it's placing more than one tab on multiple pages.  
 
I'll keep you posted...

The key is viewing the envelope in the Console GUI, that's what breaks the tag and send UI and makes it so the tabs don't display, even though they are there.  Even if you break everything up into 3 completely separate API calls 
 
1.  Create envelope
2.  Add recipient
3.  Add tab(s)
 
And then you go view the envelope in the Console you will see all the tabs show up just fine.  BUT, if you create the envelope, add the recipient, THEN you view the envelope in the Console, THEN add the tabs, the bug will be exposed and the tabs will not display.
 
With that in mind, does that help your testing at all, knowing that you don't have to actually send the envelope to view the tabs?  I.E. If you do the above steps then look through the UI they should show up.  I'll still log a bug for this but I'm wondering if that's a temp workaround for your testing?

You should be hitting the api.dsmx endpoint not the dsapi one.  
 
Are you limited to using the SOAP API or is it ok to use REST?  We actually encourage users to use REST over SOAP since REST is newer and has more features. Of course if you want you can go with SOAP you're welcome to, but if REST is an option we have two amazing tools to help you:
 
API Explorer - You can make test API calls without writing any code!  And you can see the request and response bodies and headers.  
 
API Walkthroughs - 9 of the most common use cases of DocuSign API, each written in 5 languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python)
 
If REST is not an option and you are limited to SOAP, then you should have a look at the SDK on GitHub.  It has sample projects that you can copy and run after entering your credentials and is the best way to get started with SOAP...

I created an Envelope Custom Field through my Account Preferences (calling it ""EntityId""), then in a simple PHP script I did the following:
 
$data = array ( ""accountId"" => ""<account_id>"", ""emailBlurb"" => ""Custom PHP script"", ""emailSubject"" => ""Multiple Templates Testing"", ""templateId"" => ""<template_id>"", ""status"" => $envelopeStatus, ""customFields"" => array ( ""textCustomFields"" => array (  array ( ""name"" => ""EntityId"", ""required"" => ""true"", ""show"" => ""true"", ""value"" => ""4321""))));
 
Sure enough the ""4321"" value of my custom field persisted.  The only difference I see is that I used JSON format in my request whereas you did XML.  A question for you, after you send your envelope, do you see the value of your custom field through the DocuSign UI??

Looking at the online REST API guide it defines the visible and required fields as this:
 



     required
String
When true, information must be entered into the custom field to send the envelope.


     show
String
When true, the custom field is shown to senders in the DocuSign member console during sending.

That's your problem.
 
Have you see the SOAP SDK up on GitHub?  If you're using C# then have a look at SendTemplate.aspx.cs.  It shows you how to add the role assignments in your code.  
 
// Get all the recipients
            DocuSignAPI.Recipient[] recipients = ConstructRecipients();

            // Construct the template reference
            DocuSignAPI.TemplateReference templateReference = new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReference();
            templateReference.TemplateLocation = DocuSignAPI.TemplateLocationCode.Server;
            templateReference.Template = TemplateTable.Value;
            templateReference.RoleAssignments = CreateFinalRoleAssignments(recipients);
 
Where the CreateFinalRoleAssignments() function is defined as:
 
protected DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment[] CreateFinalRoleAssignments(DocuSignAPI.Recipient[] recipients)
        {
            List<DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment> runningList = new List<DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment>();

            // Match up all the recipients to the roles on the template
            foreach (DocuSignAPI.Recipient recipient in recipients)
            {
                DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment assign = new DocuSignAPI.TemplateReferenceRoleAssignment();
                assign.RecipientID = recipient.ID;
                assign.RoleName = recipient.RoleName;

                runningList.Add(assign);

So, the DocuSign API comes in two flavors:
 
 

api.asmx (the one you are using): This one uses authentication in the SOAP header
dsapi.asmx: This one uses authentication in the HTTP header

If you use the dsapi, then you can add in your own headers, as shown in the authentication section of the API guide. While it shows how to do it with the account management API, you can do the exact same thing with dsapi.
While I haven't done what you are trying to do with your timestamp, I think that might be the place to start. You can build your own xml as you've mentioned, I can imagine that it would be much more difficult to develop and maintain.

So, to set your routing order, you must additionally set RoutingOrderSpecified to true.

One thing to note is that if you are using authentication in the SOAP header, you can add through the plain service reference without following these steps.
 
However, if you want to do HTTP header authentication, then you should follow the above guide. Our dsapi and account management API both require HTTP header authentication.

Remote signing means that your recipient gets an email prompting them to sign their documents. For this experience, do not create any CaptiveInfo for the recipient, and you do not have to request a recipient token.
Embedded signing means that you can host the signing process in your own site/application. For this experience, you will need to create CaptiveInfo on the recipient, and specify a unique ClientUserId. This identifier must be unique within the envelope.

You can combine the remote and embedded signing experiences just by specifying whether a recipient has captive information. Take a look at the samples in the SDK to see examples of both.";440;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

Here, Sender is ABC and recipient is XYZ. His requirement is Both of them can change contract templet (even if whole document file can be changed). For this reason I used RequestCorrectToken which allows me to do this. Here, ABC has account on docusing, but XYZ may not have. When XYZ tries to change templete using RequestCorrectToken(), he automatically logs in to docusing account of ABC. Now, here in another tab if XYZ open docusign console page while changing templete in another tab, he would be able to see account informaton of ABC. This happens if i create ABC and XYZ as Remote or Embedded User. Is there any way by which XYZ people dosent logs into ABC account?or Is there any another good way which provides both recipients can change templete through my web app. a part from using RequestCorrectToken()?

All you need to do is request the status of the envelope in question, using RequestStatus or RequestStatusEx. This will return RecipientStatuses, which contain multiple RecipientStatus objects. Within these objects are TabStatuses, which contain the data you require.
 
The data is separated by recipient, as you may need to know who contributed the information.

You absolutely can populate data in template fields. I just ran a quick test, and by using the FieldData property on the template reference, you can push information into the fields that are visible to both signers, irrespective of the order they sign. You can see how to do this in this blog entry.
 
However, if this is what you are doing, you may want to check to make sure that you are not concealing the value in the template. To see if you are, open your template and look at the properties of the field. Ensure that the ""Conceal entered value..."" checkbox is not checked.
 
If this is not the problem, please post a SOAP trace of your request so we can figure out what's going on.

Within this template we have defined two recipients. We have also defined all the data fields and signature tabs. For each field and tab, docusign requires that one recipient be assigned. Each field also has a configurable option (allow all to edit) which does not behave in an expected manner, as described below. Btw, the Conceal entered value option has not been set. When the allow all to edit option is set, the first signer is able to see the form with programmatically populated field data even if that signer is not assigned to the field in the template---this is the desired effect. However, the second recipient to sign sees the form with the field data populated twice---that is, the data has literally been overlaid twice and slightly offset. When the allow all to edit option is not set, the first signer does not see populated field data of fields to which they have not been assigned in the template. That is, the first signer must be the recipient assigned to the field in the template in order to see the programmatically populated field data. The desired behavior is that we programmatically populate field data into a template such that the data is visible, but not editable, to all recipients regardless of signing order and regardless of the recipient assigned to the field in template.

The option to edit is not required to view data pushed into a tab. Both recipients should be able to see the data prepopulated at the time of creation. If this is not what you are experiencing, we will need to see a SOAP trace of your CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates in order to be able to help you.

I'm not positive what's going on in terms of the overlay issue, because I cannot examine your template. I encourage you to ensure that you don't have two tabs in the same location, because that would cause you to see double.
 
To get the effect that you want, you do not need shared fields, but you do need to set your fields as locked. It's a checkbox when you go into the properties of a field. This allows you to push data into it, but not allow a recipient to edit it.

I then used the API to push the date andtime you see on the PDF into the envelope. I think I know what the problem is.
 
You are pushing a full date time into the field, when the field is only expecting a date. Therefore, it is getting cut off after the date, which is why the time looks a little strange. I will follow up on our end, to see if there is a workaround to this, but for now I suggest a couple approaches:
 
 

Since the API is pushing the data and the recipient(s) cannot edit it, make it a text box instead of a date field. The data validation then can happen programmatically.
Create a new field for the time.

Am I correct in assuming that only the fields that have date+time exhibit this behavior? Hope this helps!";644;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

step-by-step instruction manual for implementing two methods of creating and
sending envelopes out for signature with the DocuSign API. While this cookbook is written using C#, it is targeted at those using any .NET language, and most steps are consumable by developers of any language.
 

The first section addresses how to add DocuSign
as a service reference, getting your credentials and setting up the
configuration file.

 

The second section addresses sending an envelope
by using the CreateAndSendEnvelope
method. It demonstrates how to create recipients, documents and tabs as well as
how to customize the DocuSign envelope. This method allows integrators to
define needed documents and tabs on demand.

 

The third section addresses sending an envelope
by using the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates
method. It demonstrates how to create recipients, match them with predefined
tabs on the template and reference a server template. This method allows
integrators to maximize code reusability by leveraging predefined templates.

The DocumentID is an identifier to let you assign tabs and fields using the API. If you don't specify the ID, then all tabs are assumed to be on the first document. Because you can drag and drop tabs using the member console, the DocumentID is not needed and therefore not assigned. This is why the documents uploaded using the member console interface do not have an ID when requested through the API.
 
However, the order in which they are returned will always be the same -- it is the presentation order of the documents. This may take a little more bookkeeping on your end to keep track of the documents, but it is possible.

We'd like them to either: Be able to enter the value once, and have the other location automatically updated (this happens on the Custom Tabs that have validation like SSN for example, but not with Custom Text tabs,) (or) We'd like them to be able to enter the value once, and then echo that value in another place in the document.

The answer is that you absolutely can do this! To link two tabs in terms of values, simply make their tab labels the same. Any text populated in one will be reflected in the other.

Simply set the Value property to the text you wish to be default. However, to allow your recipient to edit it, you will need to set the CustomTabLocked property to false.
 
So say you have a tab named t:

It's possible to modify recipients on an in-process or draft envelope, however I don't believe you can change the type of recipients this way.  Instead, what I believe you might have to do is remove a given recipient then add them back in as a different type.

Start out all tabs in each set as hidden (or maybe have a radio button already clicked and that set initially visible) and if the user selects one of the other two radio buttons then you hide the current set and make visible the new set.  Make sense?
 
For the benefit of the community and perhaps you, here are the two tab properties in question from the REST API Guide:

conditionalParentValue

It's confusing, but the transformPdfFields property has two different uses based on where it's set.  When it's set on the document object in your JSON or XML formatted body it transfers the *values* of your PDF form fields into *existing* DocuSign tabs, given that the tabLabels match.
 
However, if transformPdfFields is set on the document object inside of a compositeTemplate then it will indeed create new DocuSign tabs, so that is actually what you want.  Here is a sample JSON body that could be used to create DocuSign Stick-eTabs:
 
{
    ""compositeTemplates"": [
        {
            ""inlineTemplates"": [
                {
                    ""sequence"": 1,
                    ""recipients"": {
                        ""signers"": [
                            {
                                ""email"": ""someone@test.com"",
                                ""name"": ""John Doe"",
                                ""recipientId"": ""1"",
                                ""defaultRecipient"": true
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ],
            ""document"": {
                ""documentId"": 1,

Secondly, when you say you had a Trial account that you moved to paid, where did you get that Trial account?  Did you get it from the Website?  (Www.docusign.com) or was it a demo account (you logged in to demo.docusign.net)? What kind of account is your paid account?  (Professional, Workgroup, Enterprise. etc)? How many users in your production account? Lastly, do you have templates in the production account (I am assuming yes)? -Dan;371;N/A;dreid;0;answer;N/A

Yes this is all possible, but for the last point (c) you don't have to specify any recipients when you save your template but you do have to specify a template role.  You'll see that when you are creating a template the recipients have a Role field.  You have to set at least one role but you can leave the name and email blank.
 
So if you have a PDF document with its static content, log into the console and start creating a template.  Add your document, and save at least one role (we'll call it Signer1).  On the ""tag-and-send"" screen where you add the DocuSign tabs to the document, drag one or two Data Field tags onto it.  These fields can be populated in through your API call, and you can give them initial values, make them editable or read only, etc.  Then in your code when you are getting ready to send a signature request using this template you reference the templateId and if you want to populate data fields you set them in the ""textTabs"" section of your request body.

The team is working to implement. I was able to get this to work using the API explorer and with some very basic test code.  First thing to note is that we were unable to do this using SOAP only. We tried everything and even the professional services and our account manager were unable to explain how to do this in SOAP.  So while it is a bit clunky we had to use a combination of REST and SOAP. (We will eventually convert everthing to REST) Step 1 - Create new member using SOAP AddMember method. Get the member ID from response Step 2 - Pull the configuration for our connect configuration by using the REST GET ConnectconfiguationbyID Step 2 - Put the configuration back with the same settings we pulled in step 2. However, we add the member ID from step 1 to the users field.   The trick here is that you cannot simply add a member id. You have to put all of the settings back and add the new member to the existing list of users or else you will break the config. Also you cannot update anything other than a custom connect configuration. This means that if you are using the standard eOriginal connect configuration you will need to create a custom connect config and duplicate the settings.;581;N/A;FP-Justin;0;answer;N/A

I received an email letting me know that a document requires my signature, and once I signed the document I received another email saying the envelope has been completed.  I would count this as one completed email, not two.  The first email is how you access the envelope to begin with, and letting me know that something requires my signature.
 
When you say that you ""get multiple signed document notifications to the signer"" I'm not seeing that.  I'm just seeing one signed document notification...

If you want to stop the one and only completed email notification that the signer recieves, I believe they would have to create their own account and then go into their settings and disable the email notifications.";454;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

When they sign the document (which requires two signatures) they are returned to our site minus the iframe and can then download the signed PDF. Every time we do this process, we are getting TWO documents signed emails rather than one. Is there any circumstance using the API that can result in this? Or is it a configuration issue?

client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""X-DocuSign-Authentication"", credentials);
string call = ""login_information"";

//calling the particular API method "" login information""
HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(call).Result This is done successfully, and i get the expected information.  Now the other 2 things(change password and  Send Envelope from Template)  I am trying to do are PUT methods and involves passing some information as parameters.As you said I have verified the parameters and tried doing things with 'http://iodocs.docusign.com/'.But I am not sure how do i pass the parameters through the code.I created a string that creates the json of all the parameters that are required to be passed in the same format as the API Explorer's request body displays. All the data being supplied is still the same, only that client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""ContentType"", ""application/json;"");  is added and the function calling the API isstring callApr = ""login_information/password"";
HttpResponseMessage response1 = client.PutAsJsonAsync(callApr, Jsonstring).Result; I am not sure if the parameters that is constructed in the Jsonstring is to be passed as a 2nd parameter to the PutAsJsonAsync() or it needs to be passed somewhere else. Passing it as 2nd parameter returns{""errorCode"": ""INVALID_CONTENT_TYPE"",""message"": ""Content Type specified is not supported.""} but the documentation says 'Content-Type: application/json' I hope I tried explaining it this time more clearly.And thanks for being patient to me and posting replies";1110;N/A;shivprasads;0;answer;N/A

This solution is running in production.  How is it possible that he is only passing a userId (As a GUID) and a password with no integrator key.  The Soap calls as i understand require the UserName to be specificed asUserName = [IntegratorKey]+UserNamePassword = Password i've seen it for myself he's gotUserName = GUIDPassword = Password Completely bafffled here.

At first it seemed that all I had to do was set the ""TransformPdfFields"" property to ""true"" on each document in the Envelope and set the ""DefaultRecipient"" and ""DefaultRecipientSpecified"" properties to ""true"" on one of the Recipients. When I do this however the documents remain read only aside from the signature tabs. After digging around the forums a bit I saw it suggested I needed to use templates to get this to work. I ended up with this: EnvelopeInformation envInfo = new EnvelopeInformation();
                        envInfo.AccountId = envelope.AccountId;
                        envInfo.EmailBlurb = envelope.EmailBlurb;
                        envInfo.Subject = envelope.Subject;

                        CompositeTemplate template = new CompositeTemplate();
                        InlineTemplate inlineTemplate = new InlineTemplate();
                        inlineTemplate.Sequence = ""1"";
                        inlineTemplate.Envelope = envelope;

                        template.InlineTemplates = new InlineTemplate[] { inlineTemplate };
                        template.Document = envelope.Documents[0];
                        template.Document.TransformPdfFields = true;
                        inlineTemplate.Envelope.Recipients[0].DefaultRecipient = true;
                        inlineTemplate.Envelope.Recipients[0].DefaultRecipientSpecified = true;

                        envStatus = client.CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms(envInfo, new CompositeTemplate[] { template }, true); Where previously I just had this:envStatus = client.CreateAndSendEnvelope(envelope); You can see I'm only using the bare minimum of the CompositeTemplate and InlineTemplate classes so I'm wondering if they're really necessary, and if so, why? This solution would also only seem to work if I need to recognize form fields on the first document in the Envelope's collection - if I need to recognize fields on multiple documents would I have to create an InlineTemplate for each of the?";277;1;amorton;0;question;

You should be able to transform the pdf fields on your second document, not sure why that wouldn't be working.  I'm not too savy with SOAP but I know in REST you could use the following JSON body to transform fields on two different documents.  I'm wondering if creating another compositeTemplate with transformPdfFields set to true would work for you?

Our API does not care what language or framework or libraries you are using, it simply accepts properly formatted requests.  Whatever language or technology you use to create that request is up to you.
 
The API Walkthroughs we have which use the CopyTo() method from .NET 4.0 are just examples to help you understand.  You are not forced to use any of that code.  
 
If you can use other functions to write the data then you can use those, if not then the Stack Overflow thread you found looks good.  Sounds like you can just implement the function yourself and they've given you some code already...

The ""Administrators"" group is a special system group that already exists, so I believe that's why you get an application error when you try to create it.  I think that and the ""Everyone"" group already exist so you can't create those.  Try creating with a different group name and see if that works.
 
For your first issue about the Send Envelopes flag not being set, I'm wondering if it has to do with activation.  When you create new users I believe they are sent an activation email, and they need to activate through the hyperlink to be active in the system.  I'm wondering if that's what causing your problem?  What does this new user look like when you view them on the Users page under Preferences?  Does it say ""Activation Sent"" under status?";446;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

1.  Create a template in the DocuSign Console.  
2.  Add your document(s) to your template on the first screen.  
3.  Also on the first screen add at least one template role.  Let's say you call the role ""Signer1"".  
4.  On the second page of template creation (i.e. the tagging screen) add your 3 tabs to the document.  You can add a Company Name tab, Employee Name, and date tab for the DOB. 
5.  Save the template and make note of the templateId.
 
Then you can make an API request which references this request and populates the values of your tabs.  If using REST API your request body would look something like:
 
{
    ""accountId"": ""221765"",
    ""emailSubject"": ""DocuSign Templates Webinar - Example 2"",
    ""emailBlurb"": ""Example #2 - Dynamically Populate Form Fields"",

            ""name"": ""Ergin Dervisoglu"",
            ""roleName"": ""Signer1"",
            ""tabs"": {
                ""textTabs"": [

                        ""value"": ""12-345-6789""

The pageNumber element is used for absolute positioning instead of relative (anchor) based positioning.  For absolute positioning you specify the page number where you want to add a specific tab... with anchor based positioning you are telling the system to place a tab wherever the text is found in the document content.  
 
Not only do the tabs get placed wherever the anchorString is found, there's actually an account option to apply this across all documents in a given envelope as opposed to just the one in question.  
 
Often times what we see developers do is they create a unique character sequence that normally wouldn't be found in the document content, maybe something like ""\s1"" or ""\i2"" to indicate signature tab for recipient 1 or initial tab for recipient 2.  Then they set the font color of these character sequences to the same color as the document background (usually white) to make the strings invisible so that you only see the tabs at those locations.  You can find more on this in the Developer Center pages as well as the REST API Guide...

I wasn't setting ""CustomTabTypeSpecified"" to true. FYI to anyone else who might have this issue! I'm just now diving into the DocuSign API after migrating from EchoSign. I'm playing with the ""Tabs"" and placement in some of more normalized paperwork. I've used the ""SignHere"" tab without any issues along with the AnchorTabItem. I see the sign here tabs as expected on the receiving end of this test document. I then went to try out some ""custom"" tabs and they are not showing up on the received document.  private Tab[] GetTabs()
        {
            List<Tab> tabList = new List<Tab>();
            Tab tab = new Tab();
            tab.Type = TabTypeCode.Custom;
            tab.CustomTabType = CustomTabType.Text;
            tab.AnchorTabItem = new AnchorTab();
            tab.AnchorTabItem.AnchorTabString = ""Applicant"";
            tab.AnchorTabItem.XOffset = 20;
            tab.AnchorTabItem.YOffset = 0;
            tab.AnchorTabItem.Unit = UnitTypeCode.Pixels;
            tab.AnchorTabItem.UnitSpecified = true;
            tab.AnchorTabItem.IgnoreIfNotPresent = false;
            tab.AnchorTabItem.IgnoreIfNotPresentSpecified = true;
            tab.DocumentID = ""1"";        
            tab.PageNumber = ""2"";
            tab.RecipientID = ""1"";
            tabList.Add(tab);

            return tabList.ToArray();
        } I'm sure I'm missing something simple here. Any assistance or something I should know about Tabs?";209;1;JordanFulford;0;question;

One point of clarification: I found that anchor text did need to be visible.  If you set the property to hidden, the anchor tab didn't work.  You could set the text color the same as the background and this is a fine solution as long as the background is not textured or an odd color. A nice enhancement would be to have the anchor specify the name of a field.  Then the field could actually be hidden.;251;N/A;jrswenson;0;answer;N/A

We require users to verify their identity prior to viewing an envelope.  If the user fails that ID check they are unable to access any envelopes for a set amount of time.  The problem is we have different employees sending out envelopes so for example: On Monday someone calls in and wants a change of address form, he speaks to Sue who sends him a DocuSign Change of Address.  Monday night that user tries to access the form but is unable to pass the ID check. Tuesday he calls in again and speaks to Jane.  Jane doesn't realize that Sue sent him a form Monday so she sends him the same form again.  He tries to access the form again but automatically fails the ID check because he's already failed the previous day. Is there any way, prior to Jane submitting the form, for the API to look out and search to see if this user has failed recently so that Jane knows that sending another envelope would be pointless?  We would have the person's name, email and certain custom fields but we would not have the envelope ID from the previous attempt.;224;1;imiller;0;question;

Ensure the actual server that hosts the application can reach https://www.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx2. Ensure that the user name for the API enabled user is still valid.3. Ensure that you still have positive balance in your DocuSign account and it's not suspended.4. Ensure that the X.509 Certificate that the application is using is not expired. We recommend that you use Thawte or VeriSign to get a certificate for you.Self signed certificates are not accepted because our servers can't validate that.Let me know if you have any questions.;404;0;Thatoldchestnut;0;question;

Everything works great, except I do not want my users to enter the 36 digits AccountID to send the documents. (I'm using CreateAndSendEvelope method) I know my program can store the AccountID somewhere so that users do not need to enter it everytime they send documents. The ideal way is users can enter their regular username(email) and password, and then my program retrieve the AccountID and store the AccountID.

To get your API credentials you will need toGo to Account -> Manage Account menu.Click on Edit Users.Select the user you need to enable for API access.Under Permissions tab you will see a check box and values for API credentials.UserName for UserNameToken security header will be in a form of Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). Some API calls require Account ID which is also given on that page in a GUID format.The password for access via API is the password set up for your user.A common mistake for application developers is that they are using their name or e-mail for the UserNameToken security header. I suspect that's what you have provided.Another thing to keep in mind is make sure that your account has API access privileges. Your development sandbox account on demo.docusign.net should have those enabled. Your production account gets API access after your application has been certified by DocuSign.;540;N/A;Thatoldchestnut;0;answer;N/A

Personally I would rather be using VS2010 at the moment, though the cost

My answer:
Our API is exposed via SOAP web services so technically any language
 and framework that supports SOAP with WS-Security headers should work 
just fine. 

Now our SDK is developed and tested only on a few select versions of the
 tools.  For example in .NET we only develop and test against Visual 
Studio 2008 (2010 coming soon).

So when you use some other tool you just need to generate your own web service proxies and use the appropriate libraries.

In .NET to get the right mix of technologies you would go with:
Visual Studio 2003 + WSE 2.0 (separate download)
Visual Studio 2005 + WSE 3.0 (separate download)
Visual Studio 2008 + WCF (built into the framework)";326;0;BeauatDocuSign;0;question;

signing.  Specifically the RequestRecipientToken call in production 
needs to have a BinarySecurityToken in the header.

I've got this question from a customer:

Mike,

We have been working on our DocuSign implementation and I have a few 
questions on certificate based authentication. While I understand that 
the certificate should be from VeriSign or Thawte does it matter what 
type of certificate we get and what the common name is? We have two 
different web servers, hosted by different providers, and each has a 
different common name/host name. When it comes time to make a web 
service call, will the request get shot down because while the request 
is coming from http://mywebsite.com the certificate's cn is http://my-other-website.com?
 Also when we go into production, the certificate that we have must be 
given to you as a *.pfx (cert with private key) correct? We currently 
have certificates through both Godaddy and Network Solutions, can we use
 either of these or should we purchase another?



Here is the answer:
1) you can use any certificate issued by a recognizable certificate 
authority.  You can check the certificate authorities installed on your 
Windows box or get an updated list from Microsoft.  VeriSign and Thawte 
are widely used and never gave us any problems.

2) the actual server where the request is coming from doesn't matter.  
As long as the certificate is available for the code to access - the XML
 Signature can be generated

3) when you go to production we just capture the common name of the 
certificate.  We don't actually need to have your export or private key.
  Exporting the certificate into a PFX will give us the common name so 
that's just one way to give us the info we need to configure the trust 
on our end.

4) we have had customers use the GoDaddy certificate and it worked.  If 
it doesn't work a basic certificate from Thawte is only a couple of 
hundred dollars so we can always fall back on that.

I hope this helps";457;0;BeauatDocuSign;0;question;

 You can have the same signer come back and sign again.  That's not a 
problem.
 
Also a quick tip for you.  You can pull up an IFRAME for people to view 
the document by calling RequestRecipientToken again.  You don't 
necessarily need to call RequestPDFs and download the file every time.

In any case there is no way to take away the signatures that have been 
applied.  This is a feature designed to protect the signers.

Conditional fields allow for the display/requirement of fields based upon the value of other (parent) fields. Let's take a look at how to do this.
 
Assume that I already have constructed the envelope, and am at the point of constructing tabs. Suppose that I have a checkbox that indicates whether or not a signer has additional information to provide. Let's construct that checkbox:
 
 
DocuSignWeb.Tab parent = new DocuSignWeb.Tab();
parent.DocumentID = ""1"";
parent.RecipientID = ""1"";
parent.PageNumber = ""1"";
parent.Type = DocuSignWeb.TabTypeCode.Custom;
parent.CustomTabType = DocuSignWeb.CustomTabType.Checkbox;
parent.CustomTabTypeSpecified = true;
parent.XPosition = ""100"";
parent.YPosition = ""200"";
parent.TabLabel = ""ProvideMoreInfo"";
 Now, how do I go about constructing the field that is conditionally displayed?
 
 
DocuSignWeb.Tab child = new DocuSignWeb.Tab();
child.DocumentID = ""1"";
child.RecipientID = ""1"";
child.PageNumber = ""1"";
child.Type = DocuSignWeb.TabTypeCode.Custom;
child.CustomTabType = DocuSignWeb.CustomTabType.Text;
child.CustomTabTypeSpecified = true;
child.ConditionalParentLabel = ""ProvideMoreInfo"";
child.ConditionalParentValue = ""Checked"";
child.XPosition = ""100"";
child.YPosition = ""300"";
 
 
 
Add these tabs to the envelope, and you are good to go!
 
Caveats:
The label and value of the parent are case-sensitive. Be sure that ""Checked"" is capitalized! If you aren't seeing the correct behavior of your conditional tabs, that is the first thing you should check.

If you take a look at the raw wsdl and search for the the string ""specified,"" you won't find it. So why do you see it when you are coding up your solution?
 
One important thing to note is that this only happens with variables such as booleans or ints, and only with boolean or int variables that have a minimum occurrence of 0 -- meaning that they are optional. However, because booleans and ints represent value types, you cannot set them as null.
 
When you add a service reference, the proxy generator generates the <PropertyName>Specified property for each of these optional properties. Take a look at this msdn article to get the full explanation of what happens. What it boils down to is that when you want to set variable <PropertyName> and it also has a Specified counterpart, you need to set them both. The article indicates that pretty much everyone will be bitten by unexpected results because they don't set both at one time or another, and I can confirm this!

So I would recommend checking .Status. The reason we were checking SentSpecified is because the test should send the envelope. If you are just looking to check to see what state the envelope is in, you should check .Status. That will give you statuses such as Delivered, Sent, Created, Voided, etc...
 
For the record, .Sent is a DateTime, which also is included in the list above (bool, int).

This indicates a stale message ...;http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-NET-READ-ONLY/WSE066-Timestamp-is-expired-This-indicates-a-stale-message/td-p/1477;Hi-We have successfully integrated the Docusign API into our client application product last year.  Now, our goal is to create a server side application.  In a very slimmed down version of what we are doing, I have created a simple ASPX page that takes user input (userid, password, and integrator key) and will use the Credential API to login and and access the Account ID, and then will use the APIService API to create a very simple envelope.  Normally I have our integrator key hard coded in our code but for security purposes, I removed it and added it as an input field right now.To keep this very simple, if the process is successful, it will just return the Envelope ID to the window.  It works great on when I run this code locally using my local web server (local host) through the Visual Studio IDE.  However, when I post to our web server, we receive the following error:WSE066: Timestamp is expired. This indicates a stale message but may also be caused by lack of synchronization between sender and receiver clocks. Make sure the clocks are synchronized or use the timeToleranceInSeconds element in the microsoft.web.services3 configuration section to adjust tolerance for lack of clock synchronizationI have researched this error and all answers say to make sure that microsoft.web.services3 has a default value for clock sync skew to be five minutes, but it can be changed in the web.config to allow for more clock skew.  This can be changed using the timeToleranceInSeconds element that is within the security element of the microsoft.webservices3 element in the web.config file.I have made this adjustment in the client web.config but it still presents the error.    My soap trace log is attached A few other points to note: The server I am trying to stage this on does have a clock out of sync, but the last resort would be to fix the setting, since it's been off for so long and other things will be affected by changing this clock on this server.  I can reproduce this error locally if I change my system time and have it off by more than five minutes, then run my application locally through the Visual Studio IDE.  So I do know that it IS indeed the clock skew problem, and as a last resort, I could fix our clock on the server, but I would prefer to find a better solution since it's likely to occur elsewhere.This application was created in Visual Studio 8.  It's a simple HTML form with an ASP code behind that has two service references to the Docusign API and Credential APIs.The other solution I thought about was that maybe I should create my own soap header, and that would allow me to use use an internet time for the datetime and expiration time of the soap request.Is there something else I can be doing to fix this?  The solutions I found on the web indicate that this setting in web.config needs to be set on the client and the server config, so I don't know if my hands are tied here.The problem is reproduceable if I change the clock setting on the web server (I haven't done it on our main web server because it impacts other things, but I can change my local system clock and run my solution as a local web server via the Visual Studio IDE.  Does anybody have any other suggestions or alternative solutions here?Thanks!;2184;5;jm18184;0;question;

Also when looking at the structure of the JSON objects we are sending and receiving, we can see that tabs are grouped into arrays based on their type.

Yes you can absolutely add multiple tabs to your signature requests.  You just have to build the corresponding JSON (or XML) formatted request body with all the tabs you want.  
 
You can use the API explorer to see samples of these, under the Request Signatures tab send a signature request on a document (i.e. not from a template) and you'll see what the request body looks like.  Once you add at least one recipient you can then add whichever tabs you want in the request:
 
http://www.docusign.com/developer-center/quick-start/api-explorer
 
You should also read the Stick-eTabs page of the Features section in the Developer Center, there's more examples and some great info such as info on Anchor Tabs for instance:

The user has the option to attach additional PDFs to the envelope before sending.  The user can optionally set the attachments to appear before the actual contract defined by the template by changing a sequence number.  This all works well and when the customer opens up the document, he/she sees the attachment in the appropriate place (either before or after the contract). The problem is that the API call(s) used to generate the contract print preview don't work with the additional attached document.  Instead, the PDFs returned by the ""RequestPDFWithOptions"" as well as the ""RequestPDFsWithOptions"" SOAP methods return duplicates of the first document in the sequence.  I'll illustrate with an example:  1. The user creates an envelope from template ""Standard Contract"".  This template includes the one PDF called ""contract.pdf"" with the Tabs defined on it.2. The user adds an attachment PDF to the envelope called ""attachment.pdf"".  He/she decides to place the attachment before the PDF, so that the recipient will see it first before signing the contract.3. The user clicks our ""Preview and Send"" button which saves the envelope to the DocuSign API but does not send it yet.  At this point, the application makes an API call to ""RequestPDFsWithOptions"".    a.  API call returns two ""DocumentPDF"" instances.  They look like the following:        i.  First            1.  Name: ""attachment.pdf""            2.  PDFBytes: Length=245378        ii.  Second            1.  Name: ""contract.pdf""            2.  PDFBytes: Length=2453374. Application shows a window allowing the user to preview the two documents returned.  Unfortunately, ""contract.pdf"" is showing the same thing as ""attachment.pdf"".5. Dismayed user clicks the send button anyway, unable to verify the contract.6. First recipient views contract in DocuSign and everything is as expected.   In summary, everything seems to get across to docusign just fine and the contracts are able to be completed correctly.  However, the API method is not returning correct data.  Note that the ""RequestPDFWithOptions"" call has the same problem as the ""RequestPDFsWithOption"" call.  It returns a single combined PDF, but shows the same duplication problem. I've also attached a SOAP dump from our test environment which illustrates the issue. Personally, this looks like a bug in DocuSign's API, though they suggested I bring this issue to the community first.  I'm pretty sure there isn't a special settings that tells the API to return a list of documents in an envelope with the correct names yet duplicate only the first documents PDF bytes although they don't match the names.  Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions or work-arounds, they will be appreciated.

Our apologies for the delay on this as this thread seems to have slipped through.  I was trying to test this earlier today but realized that our SOAP SDK does not have the RequestPDFsWithOptions() call in it.

I'm accessing the SOAP web service directly instead of using an SDK (I didn't know you had one available).  I'm in a .NET world, so I used Visual Studio to generate the classes and proxies required for working with the SDK.  From there the VB.NET code looks as follows: Dim pdfOptions = New PDFOptions() With {.AddWaterMark = True, .ShowChanges = True} Dim previewResults = ExecuteSoap(Function(client) client.RequestPDFWithOptions(strEnvelopeID, pdfOptions))'Render the PDF bytes returned in the previewResults.PDFBytes property. Note that in this case I'm using the RequestPDFWithOptions(...) method instead of the RequestPDFsWithOptions(...).  I'm sure your familiar with the distinction between the two, but this one just keeps all the contracts bundled as one instead of split out into multiple files.  I got the same behavior with both calls, so I'm assuming that they're using shared code underneath. Regardless, I did post a SOAP trace which should reflect the nature of the .NET call.

Our software calls the API to create the envelope from the template.  Web Console is not used at this point. - When you mention the user adds an ""attachment PDF"", is that simply them adding another document to the envelope, or are you talking about a Signer Attachment recipient tab?  My assumption is the former.We're adding another document here to the envelope.  The template will generally have one, but in some cases we want to customize what is sent to the recipient (say, add an explanation or maybe an addendum before sending the original contract).  Sometimes we need this to appear before the original document. - Also during step 2, is the user adding the attachment.pdf doc through the API or through the Web Console?Through the API. * Just to note, everything appears correct when the recipient opens the contract.  It's simply that the print preview call is screwed up.  The actual contract process works, it's just that the RequestPDFWithOptions() method doesn't work right (right in my point of view, anyway).

We add attachment.pdf in step one from the template, set it's sequence (along with the template document) and then pass all that to the CreateEnvelope service.  See the steps we take below: RequestTemplate(templateID) to get the template.  We then grab the envelope off the template object and set many of its properties, including email settings, notifications, recipients.  We also add any additional documents needed (addenda, etc) and set document sequences.  We also set initial values based on data we have.CreateEnvelope(envelope).  We pass the envelope we configured from step 1 to the CreateEnveloope SOAP method to get an EnvelopeID back.RequestPDFWithOptions(envelopeID).  We pass the envelopeID to the RequestPDFWithOptions method to get the print-preview we're concerned about.  This is the call that returns bad data.SendEnvelope(envelopeID).  If the user is satisfied with the print preview from step 3, he/she clicks the ""send"" button and we call the send envelope method. -Lance";498;N/A;lancelewis77;0;answer;N/A

I had been working with your account manager Rob on Friday and so far have not been able to reproduce this issue based on the latest flow you've listed.  I asked Rob to get a solution engineer or someone from our ProServe team to take a look at this issue since I can't reproduce and since I'm stronger with REST than SOAP.

Just want to make sure I understand your question- are you asking if you can setup a template such that when your users are getting ready to send an envelope for signature request they can select a template and have text fields, drop downs, or other potential Stick-eTabs filled out with initial values before they send?

So I just tested this and I was able to get template fields for a given role to populate with initial values just by configuring things through the Console (Template) UI. 
 
I added a drop down list with 4 values, having the 2nd value selected by default.  I added a Data Field tab which had the initial value I added through the UI, and the same for a Company tab.  Then through an API call I referenced the template and when I openened the envelope for signing all tabs had the correct initial values.
