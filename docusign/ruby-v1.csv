In my testing I can see the Docusign Status records being created correctly by Docusign for Salesforce, but they are not being associated to the Opportunities automatically.  Where in the createandsendenvelope API call can i specify which Opportunity to relate the Status record to?

I wanna know whether DocuSign supports us to send the email request to signer by calling API methods. I did some research on DocuSign's API documentation, but no luck with that. Here is the detail about what I want to do. For example, we have 3 signers for a contract to sign, their order is 1,2,3. After the 1st person, who is our client, signs the contract, is it possible to prevent DocuSign send the request to the 2nd person? Why we are doing this is that we need to approve this contract internally before the 2nd person can sign it. We want to send the request to the 2nd person manaully after this contract is approved by calling DocuSign's API. Do anybody know if it's possible?;523;3;jeffreyyuan;0;question;

At the fundamental level there are two different types of recipients you can have- remote recipients or embedded recipients.  Remote recipients use email links to initiate requests, sign envelopes, etc.  Embedded recipients, on the other hand, do not use email at all but instead use authenticated URL tokens to access envelopes and sign documents.  
 
For a given envelope you can have a combination of remote and embedded (aka captive) recipients, so for your use case you could have the first recipient setup as a remote recipient and the second setup as an embedded recipient.  This way once the first recipient signs, the second recipient will not be able to sign until a URL token is generated for them.  At this point you can put your contact through your internal approval process, and if declined void the envelope, if approved generate a URL token for the second recipient and have them navigate to it.  (If you wanted I guess you could mimic the email notification by including the link in an email to the recipient).  The URL tokens do, however, have a TTL (time to life) of 5 minutes, which means that they expire after 5 minutes if not accessed by then.  At that point a new token would need to be generated.    
 
You can test this out through the API Explorer tool (see the Views section), and the last 3 API Walkthroughs all demonstrate embedding functionality.";518;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Another option I was thinking of is using the Editor, Agent, or Manage Envelope recipient types.  With those types, once it's their turn in the routing order they are supposed to enter the information for the remaining recipients, such as name and email address.  Once they have done that, the request continues on to the remaining recipients that they have now specified, based on routing order.
 
Yet another option I was thinking of but is a little more of a hack, is if you specify slightly incorrect information for a recipient and then do a recipient correction (changing to the correct email address).  With that you could basically prevent it from going to a recipient by having the wrong info, then you could POST the correct information once you approve the application and it would then go to the next recipient.

First off, why are you doing an extra PUT call after the first recipient signs and before the second one receives?  Is that just to resend the email, because the email is not getting sent in the first place?  
 
Generally speaking, if you setup 3 recipients with routing order 1, 2, 3, and each of them is supposed to sign, then our system will automatically send an email to the next recipient when it's their turn.  If this is not happening, my first question is if the emails are being caught by any security or other type of filtering done on that email domain.  Is the domain of the second recipient email the same as the domain of the first recipient email?  
 
Next, I want to make sure you're not setting up any of the recipients as ""Embedded"" recipients, by setting their clientUserIds.  You are not using this property, correct?  If you are, then the system will not send them emails when it's their turn, instead you'd have to generate a URL token in that case...";957;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Business scenario for the second PUT call: 1. Email domains are different for the all the recipients. 2. There are three recipients:           a) Customer               -- Routing Order 1         b) Channel Partner  -- Routing Order 2         c) Company              -- Routing Order 33. When we initiate the docuSign workflow for the first time, the envelop contains all the recipients and the DocuSign will email the recipients based on the routing order.  In the above scenario if any of the recipient doesn't receive the email due to security filters on their domains OR lost due to accidental delete, we would like to resend the email only for the recipients who have not signed in the workflow order using the DocuSign provided Resend PUT call.  NOTE: In the normal scenario we have tested all the recipients are receiving the emails from DocuSign based on the routing order -- No issues and working as expected.  In case of Resend, only the first recipient is receiving the email from DocuSign for the second time only if the recipient has not signed the document  -- No issues and working as expected. Scenario not working: 1. Initiate the docusign workflow with more than one recipient2. First recipient has signed the document3. DocuSign will notify the second recipient to sign4.

The way it works is that there is the custom DocuSign Status object that our system writes to, and there is a general user (the api user that you are seeing) that is the only allowed user to write to that custom object.  Unfortunately this is how the system currently functions, but we might have a way of changing the app to stop this from happening.
When you say that all the others can see the sensitive information on the document, is that through the custom DocuSign Status object or through the Salesforce opportunity.  If it's through the Salesforce opportunity you can limit that through your SF security settings.  
 
If it's through the DS Status object then we're wondering if our service did NOT copy the completed signed doc back to the status object (or at least had an option not to copy it) if that would resolve your security issue?  So in other words the completed doc would be available on the opportunity, but not the status object.  Would that work for your needs?";875;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Two questions for you- 1) are you limited to using Ruby? 2) are you limited to using SOAP and not able to implement RESTful web services? 
 
The reason I ask is because we have a newer, easier to use API which uses the REST protocol which we actually encourage, so any langauge that can make http GET, POST, PUT, etc. web requests can interact with DocuSign services that way.  For instance, we have two fantastic tools to help you get going in REST with sample code and all.  Unfortunately we don't have sample Ruby code (I will look into adding those) but we do have use cases written in 5 sample languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python).  And the API Explorer let's you make REST API calls through the page and you can see the actual request and response bodies and headers.  Really helpful tools:

Not a huge deal if you don't have examples, I can follow pretty much any other language.2) This I'm not sure about.  I'll give you all the information I know about how we do things and then you can probably tell me if I can use the REST API or not. Looking at the code, it looks like we set a few recipients, the insured and the sales support agent that helped them with the case.  We're logging in with the specific agent's username/password I believe for tracking purposes? I'm not quite sure why we aren't using a master account, I think it's so that the agents can manually go into their docusign and view their cases afterwards. We are storing a template_id on our side of the docusign template on your servers, and then we are making a request to get that template on our side.  We then fill out the template with data on our side, and then create an envelope from that finished template.  Finally, we send a request to get a ""sender_token"" which we then use to open up a new docusign window that the agent sees that has all of the information filled out.  This is done because they're on the phone with the customer and so they can continue with the signing without having to call back later. It looks like we can do most things through the REST API, which I agree would be much better to use, but hopefully that last part about being able to open a new window that puts the agent right into the Docusign flow is also doable.

And yes, you can definitely put your users directly into DocuSign flow.  We can call that ""Embedding"" functionality.  You can automatically launch your users into the ""tag-and-send"" flow, the signing workflow, and or the drop them off right in the admin console (where they can pretty much do anything based on their settings).  
 
See the last 3 API Walkthroughs (highlighted in red) for examples of Embedding functionality.

I posed your question to some of our Salesforce gurus and here's the response I received, along with a salesforce trigger you can use:

The trigger would go on DocuSign Status, which receives the notification.
 
Here is a sample trigger, which will change STAGE on OPPORTUNITY when COMPLETE.
 
They might modify this.  This is obviously a salesforce technology solution, but they can also do same with a CONNECT rule.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
And here is the sample trigger they provided:
 
trigger UpdateOpportunityStageName on dsfs__DocuSign_Status__c (after insert, after update) {



try

 {

    system.debug('In trigger');

    dsfs__DocuSign_Status__c dssNew = Trigger.new[0];  

    dsfs__DocuSign_Status__c dssOld = null; 

    if (!System.Trigger.isInsert) dssOld = Trigger.old[0];

    if (System.Trigger.isInsert || dssOld.dsfs__Envelope_Status__c != dssNew.dsfs__Envelope_Status__c)

    {

        if (dssNew.dsfs__Envelope_Status__c == 'Completed')

        {

           Opportunity o = [select StageName from Opportunity where id=:dssNew.dsfs__Opportunity__c];

           if (o != null)

           {

             o.StageName = 'Closed Won';

             upsert o;

           }

        }

    }

}

Salesforce workflow is a very powerful and easy way to trigger field updates, based on record insertion or changes.  DocuSign CONNECT will insert a record into DocuSign Status, and modify it as the envelope status changes, such as ""Declined"".  No coding on either DocuSign or Salesforce is required.  Simply set up a CONNECT rule, to trigger the appropriate action, whenever the DocuSignStatus.Status field is updated.

There are quite a few different ways to approach this problem in ColdFusion, but the following example is pretty easy to follow. The main thing to get out of the way early is, don't try to use cfinvoke. Though cfinvoke is convenient for integrating with simple SOAP APIs, it does not work (at least easily) with the DocuSign API. The approach we are going to take is to use cfhttp. This method requires us to handle some of the low-level implementation details of SOAP, but is the most convenient method to use with ColdFusion. Create the SOAP Header We are going to construct the entire SOAP message using XML. We start with the SOAP header. We will need to set the username and password in the security header. The security header also requires an element called a ""nonce"" which refers to a number used only once. This number should be generated randomly with each call and must be base64 encoded.  <cfset UserName = ""[XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX]XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX"" />
<cfset Password = ""SuperSecret"" />

<cfscript>
  strNonce = ToBase64(createUUID());
</cfscript>

<!-- create the request body XML block -->
<cfsavecontent variable=""request_xml"">

</cfoutput>
</cfsavecontent>Make sure to include your integrator key for the wsse:UserName element.  Create the SOAP Body Next, we are going to construct the XML for the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates() API method call. In this example, I am making use of a Template that I have created in the Member Console.    <soap:Body>
    <ns:CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates>
      <ns:TemplateReferences>
        <ns:TemplateReference>
          <ns:TemplateLocation>Server</ns:TemplateLocation>

      </ns:Recipients>
      <ns:EnvelopeInformation>
        <ns:AccountId>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</ns:AccountId>
        <ns:EmailBlurb>This Envelope was sent through the DocuSign API using ColdFusion</ns:EmailBlurb>
        <ns:Subject>DocuSign it! using ColdFusion</ns:Subject>
      </ns:EnvelopeInformation>
      <ns:ActivateEnvelope>true</ns:ActivateEnvelope>
    </ns:CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates>
  </soap:Body>You will need to create your own template and plug in the correct Template ID into the XML. You will also need to use your AccountID. If you are using a different API method, then you can create your XML as appropriate.  Sending the Request We will use the cfhttp tag to actually send the request.  <!-- send the request to the DocuSign service -->
<cfhttp url=""https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx"" method=""post"" result=""http_response"">

  <!-- make sure you set this correctly for the call you are making -->
  <cfhttpparam type=""header"" name=""SOAPAction"" value=""http://www.docusign.net/API/3.0/CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates"" />

  <cfhttpparam type=""header"" name=""accept-encoding"" value=""no-compression"" />
  <cfhttpparam type=""xml"" value=""#trim(request_xml)#"" />
</cfhttp>Please note that you need to make sure the value you set for SOAPAction is the correct one for the method you wish to call. Handling the Response To handle the SOAP response from the service, it is easiest to use ColdFusion's built-in XML methods. Using the xmlSearch() method along with an XPath expression, we can quickly return the top level XML element of the response from within the larger SOAP respose XML.  <!-- if we received a successful response -->
<cfif find(""200"", http_response.statusCode)>
  <cfscript>
    response_xml = xmlParse(http_response.fileContent);
	
	// use XPath to get the top level element you want from the SOAP response
	result_node = xmlSearch(response_xml, ""//*[local-name() = 'CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesResult']"")[1];
	
	// use dot notation to navigate the XML structure
	envelope_id = result_node.EnvelopeID.xmlText;
  </cfscript>
  
  <cfoutput>
    EnvelopeID: #envelope_id#
  </cfoutput>
<cfelse>
  <cfoutput>
    An error occurred!
  </cfoutput>
  <cfdump var=""#http_response#"">
</cfif>First, you will note that we are verifying that the request was successful by checking for an HTTP status of ""200"". In my example, I am simply dumping the HTTP response object in the case of a failure; your code will need to do some appropriate error handling. Once we have the top-level XML node (result_node) that we want from the response, we can access sub elements using ""dot notation"" (e.g. ""result_node.EnvelopeID.xmlText"").  Summary In this article, I showed how to make a CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates() call using ColdFusion. Making calls to other API methods will follow the same basic process as shown above. The main differences will be in the actual XML structure of the request and response. Please see the published API documentation on the DocuSign DevCenter for a detailed description of the API. The full ColdFusion example is attached to this post

First, please try using the api.asmx endpoint instead of the dsapi.asmx endpoint just to make sure that's not the issue.  I'm not sure what the differences are but I've been told that the api.asmx enpoint is the one you should for SOAP.  I.E.-
https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx
 
If that's not the issue, the error seems to indicate there is a problem with your anchor tags.  Are you positive they are in your document?  If so, for testing purposes try using absolute positining instead of anchor positing to see if that makes a difference.  So instead of using the anchorTabItem try setting tab1.XPosition and tab1.YPosition.";830;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Here is the workflow we would like to see: Prospect comes to our website and clicks ""Sign Up"".Prospect fills out a form for us to collect their data and becomes a Signer.Signer's data is input into PDF files (using pdftk to combine a .fdf file with a .pdf).IRS W-9ContractEtc.Envelope is created in DocuSign's API using 'CreateAndSendEnvelope' along with an 'EventNotification' so I know when the signing is complete. Signer is presented with instructions and a giant ""Click here to Sign"" button.Signer is given a new window (target=""_blank"") and taken to DocuSign.  This is where I need help constructing a URL.Original window uses an AJAX call to check the status , and presents a ""Congratulations!"" screen when completed with additional instructions.This seems like it should be a common workflow, but I do not see the URL anywhere in the response objects.

We have this scenario extensively documented.
 
Our SDK Wiki location that has a code walkthrough for embedded signing.
 
We also have a lot of sample code on Github.  
 
Here is a link to embeddocusign.php file that shows this example. Look into getToken function.

You should also be able to create an envelope from template without having to upload another PDF and you can add additional tabs:

As you probably know, you can do this through the console: After you send an envelope, you have the option to send a similar one or create a template based upon the envelope you just sent.
 
Unfortunately, you can't determine the template used in the creation of an envelope at this time -- either with the API or the console. You would have to keep track of an enevelopeID <-> templateID mapping manually. It's an interesting idea though...";307;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

This is actually a fairly common problem with people using web services with Apex.
 
While I'll be checking with some people about this, one of the things you can do is minimize the number of tests you need to write. To do this, simply delete all the generated code pertaining to method calls you do not use. So if you do not use CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates, delete the generated code for it! Then, you do not have to cover it.
 
When you say that you are not able to write the test methods, what problems are you encountering? Here is a link from the developerforce wiki that explains how to test web service calls.";1243;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

Salesforce doesn't have any special test support for WSDL-generated proxy classes. The methods are web callouts so there isn't really anything that makes sense to test.  What DocuSign does for testing is:
 
1. Comment out the unused classes and callouts in the WSDL-generated proxy class.  This removes the need to write tests for unused code - which should be the majority of the WSDL-generated code.  We prefer commenting it out over deleting, as in the future, if a refresh of the WSDL-class is needed, it would be easier to compare differences.
 
2. For the remaining WSDL-generated classes, our test code instantiates each class with no real testing. The classes are for data transfer and are auto-generated by Salesforce so it doesn't make sense to test them.  The test method would look similar to this:
 


private class Test_DSAPI {
 
    static testMethod void myUnitTest() {
        new DSAPI.SSN9Information();
        new DSAPI.ArrayOfCustomField();
        new DSAPI.Attachment();
        new DSAPI.AvailableFolders();
        new DSAPI.UpdateAddressBookResult();
        new DSAPI.RecipientEsignList();
            ...
            ...


 
3. Salesforce tests do not support web-callouts, but the setup code in the WSDL-generated classes before each web-callout accounts for several lines of code that are included in the test results, which if reported as untested can easily prevent the developer from generating an installation package.  We handle this by adding a class with a public static variable that we set in each test method that indicates testing is being performed.  The class is something like this:
 


public with sharing class UnitTestSettings {
 
    // Set this global to turn on unit test mode. All classes should
    // look at this variable when they care about unit tests vs normal runs.
    public static Boolean PerformingUnitTests = false;
}

 

 
A test method does this as its first line:
 


    public static testMethod void runTest(){
        UnitTestSettings.PerformingUnitTests = true;
            ...
 
 
In the WSDL-generated classes, we change the WebServiceCallout.invoke lines to only callout if not testing. For example:
 
 
if (!UnitTestSettings.PerformingUnitTests) WebServiceCallout.invoke(
 
 
and also add a return statement above the real return statement to return a default object, for example:
 
 
            if (UnitTestSettings.PerformingUnitTests) return new 		    DSAPI_AccountManagement.NewAccountResult_element();
            return response_x.NewAccountResult;
 
 
Finally, any place in the code that would use the return object might need to also check the  UnitTestSettings.PerformingUnitTests flag and set acceptable test values for the returned values.  For example:
 
 DSAPI_AccountManagement.NewAccountResult_element result =
              dsApiAcctMgmt.NewAccount(NewAcctAccountName,
                                       NewAcctDistributorCode,
                                       NewAcctDistributorPassword,
                                       NewAcctPgp,
                                       NewAcctCreditCardInformation,
                                       NewAcctReferralInformation,
                                       NewAcctAccountSettings,
                                       NewAcctMember,
                                       NewAcctAddressInformation);
 
      if (UnitTestSettings.PerformingUnitTests)
      {
            // set ""test values"" in the returned result object here.
            ...
      }

From looking over the code again you can see that formhandler.php is the document that sets up your envelope and prepares you for embedded signing. Within this file is a call to api.php which is being used to set up the entire service. Within api/api.php there is a method called getClientCallBackURLs() which is setting up the various responses to each situation the client could end up with ( all of which end at pop.html ). If you have NOT altered the code in this file or formhandler.php then this is what should occur. You are saying that the example does not seem to be responding as expected though... This callback URL method is called within the makeRequestRecipientToken() method further down in api and THAT method is used within the formhandler in order to prepare the Recipient token for embedded signing. Perhaps the way that you are ending the embedded signing is the cause of the problem, but this path should lead you in the right direction.

New requirements specify that these templates now need co-signed. As I understand it, to add multiple people to sign a document requires that multiple recipients are added to the envelope options before calling CreateAndSendEnvelope(), and then with the RequestRecipientToken(), you'd pass the user data and the envelope to get the token. That is alright for the embedded user that is signing at that moment, but how do you handle the second signer, either embedded or remote? By creating another RequestRecipientToken() for the second signer, wouldn't the ttl on the token exist. Also, when will the signed version of the document be available for download? Is it not until after the second signer has completed their signing.;779;2;joeytrapp;0;question;Embedded. Multiple Signers

Sorry for the delay in getting you a response. To answer your question: RequestRecipientToken is recipient-specific, so it will not expire if you call it for the second signer. Also, the document would be available to download at any time, but it would only contain the signatures of whoever had signed at that point.;748;N/A;nicholasareed;1;answer;N/A

Specifically, I have a customer in the field who claims the he isn't seeing his shared templates through my product.  I've tried to reproduce the problem here, but to no avail - my shared templates always show up. So my questions are... 1) Are there different ways to share templates? I share mine through the web console by merely checking the Shared box. 2) Are there any access restrictions when sharing templates? Asked differently, how does one control/specify the identities of the people with whom templates are to be shared? When I checked the Shared box through the web console, I assume I am sharing these templates with other users of my ""org"" (?) 3) Are there any API considerations surrounding the issue of enumerating shared templates? In my RequestTemplates call, I specify my own AccountID as the only argument. Is there some other AccountID that needs to be specified to pick up other types of shared templates? 4) Is it possible to get a second dev account to test this template sharing mechanism/dynamic?

This Approve/Reject should use DocuSign. Users performing these actions are in the same team,they are part of a ""client"" space.My current implementation workflow works like this:1. User A logs in to DocuSign using his own DocuSign credentials, not the application's DocuSign credentialsI thought about this because I don't want users to see other users documents (users belonging to a totally different client space)and because the users can manage better the documents in their own DocuSign accounts.2. User A is creating and sending the envelope having user B as recipient, using my application's DocuSign integrators API key +the user's own account id (first account returned by credentials API call)3. User B is receiving the email from DocuSign, and approves/rejects the document.I tested this solution in 3 cases:First I used my application's DocuSign credentials and it worked.Then I used a totally different DocuSign dev account credentials, and it worked too.Third time I used a Docusign account credentials (which is not a dev account) and it didn't work,the authentication failed with ""One or both of Username and Password are invalid.""I'm not sure what this means.Only dev accounts are allowed to make such calls ?Is it because my current integrators API key is not a production one ?Is it because I didn't choosed the correct implementation ?

The problem here is that some (or most) of these templates have multiple documents that the client needs to sign, and when I make a call to RequestTemplates, the ones with multiple pages are not coming back in the call. In fact, some of the old templates we've been using have had additional documents updated on them, and they no longer come back from the RequestTemplates call either.  I still have the GUID and name saved in our database, so the API functions all still work, but is confusing for the admin users when they can't see that the template is selected (the drop-down we use is based on the response from RequestTemplates, so when the template GUID isn't being returned, the drop-down is blank). To test this, I logged into my developer account, and found 5 templates.  All 5 had only one document uploaded to them.  I called RequestTemplates, and got back all 5.  I added an additional document to one of the templates, and then called RequestTemplates again, and only got back 4.  I looked in the documenation to see if anything had been updated since I last looked, and saw an ""IncludeAdvancedTemplates"" option.  However, I tried using it, setting it to true, and still only got back 4 templates.  There must be something I'm missing!";1196;6;eclarizio;0;question;RequestTemplates. ruby

In case anyone is using the old one like I was, and needs this functionality, here's the changes: In lib/docusign/docusignMappingRegistry.rb, change this::schema_element => [
      [""accountID"", [""SOAP::SOAPString"", XSD::QName.new(NsC_30, ""AccountID"")], [0, 1]]
    ] To this::schema_element => [
      [""accountID"", [""SOAP::SOAPString"", XSD::QName.new(NsC_30, ""AccountID"")], [0, 1]],
      [""includeAdvancedTemplates"", [""SOAP::SOAPBoolean"", XSD::QName.new(NsC_30, ""IncludeAdvancedTemplates"")]]
    ]  In the lib/docusign/docusign.rb, add in another attr_accessor and change the initialize method.  Here's mine:class RequestTemplates
  attr_accessor :accountID
  attr_accessor :includeAdvancedTemplates

  def initialize(accountID = nil, includeAdvancedTemplates = false)
    @accountID = accountID
    @includeAdvancedTemplates = includeAdvancedTemplates
  end
end And finally, in the lib/DocuSign3.0.10API.wsdl file, add this line within the RequestTemplates sequence (the same place the account id element is):<s:element minOccurs=""1"" maxOccurs=""1"" name=""IncludeAdvancedTemplates"" type=""s:boolean"" /> This lets me use the includeAdvancedTemplates flag but doesn't change any of the other functionality like uploading templates that we need to rely on a day to day basis.

I've confirmed we're not sending it in production and everything is working fine. Also, just FYI, email address and password are required for RequestSenderToken, sending accountID is optional and is only used to link the envelope to an account.

The ""docusignsdk"" and ""docusign"" gems are nearly the same, I believe the only difference is ""docusignsdk"" has cert file location options. 
 
In https://github.com/texel/docusign/blob/ruby19/lib/docusign/base.rb check under ""def credentials"" and compare it to https://github.com/nicholasareed/docusignsdk/blob/master/lib/docusign/base.rb. 
 
To have your cert file specified, I believe you need to include:

I would try to get Salesforce to handle proper http protocol. This really is the right way of moving forward. A product team - any product team - will likely not want to expose a flag though which one can turn on/off the http 100 continue header.  Making changes to production system because a web service does not implement proper http protocol is generally frawn upon.
 
I'll let you know once I hear back from the product team about what they will do. In the meantime....please see if you can get Salesforce to fix their web service class.

Have you peeked any of the online documentation we have in the DevZone?  There are some useful walkthroughs and code snippets you can review to help get you started.  I'd start with our iodocs website which can be found here:
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/
 
That links starts you out in the API Explorer, and at the top right you can navigate to the API Walkthrough which has sample code for 9 common tasks, such as creating and sending envelopes as well as requesting signatures.
 
Here is also a link for the actual Rest API as well:  http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/RESTAPIGuide.htm
 
- EDIT -
Oh and another useful link is github's tutorial for creating and sending an envelope:

I've found that you can dynamically assign the value of a Data Field through API calls but so far I'm not sure if the same can be done with tags like Company, Title, etc.  So far it seems that those type of fields are inputted by the siger(s) during the actual signing process, but I'll try to confirm that.  
 
If you take the steps you've outlined in your last post (i.e. create a document in the sandbox, drag the Data Field tag (not Company) into the document, and create and save a template out of that), then you can assign the value of that tag using the ""tabLabel"" and ""value"" headers just as you've specified.  This thread also talks about the same thing:

I guess just to triple check, you are using the correct corresponding templateId for the given template in use, right?  In other words, templateId ""20A24....."" matches the one you're editing in the DocuSign console view correct?  
 
Also, I can't see the document section of your console, please verify the document name and order matches your code.  
 
If all of things match then for debugging purposes I might try testing with a more simple test document that only has a Data Field tab and see if you can get that to work.  When I originally read your post and then tested all of this myself I had a very simple case like the one I just outlined (i.e. just a signature and a data field) and I was able to populate the value of the data field through the API request.  My json request body was relatively simple, and it only contained the following elements.  See if you can mimic this with a test file on your side...
 
{ ""status"": ""sent"", ""emailSubject"": ""Testing DocuSign templates:"", ""emailBlurb"": ""This comes from Java"", ""templateId"": ""<ENTER YOUR TEMPLATE ID>"", ""templateRoles"": [ { ""email"": ""<ENTER EMAIL>"", ""name"": ""<ENTER NAME>"", ""roleName"": ""<ENTER ROLE>"", ""tabs"": { ""textTabs"": [ { ""tabLabel"": ""CompanyName"", ""value"": ""My test Company Name"" } ] } } ]}
 
If you can get that to work, then start adding in your more complex elements one by one (such as your radio buttons) and see if the addition of one of your elements eventually breaks the logic, then can go from there...

I'm not sure if your pdf has any security behind it that's maybe stopping the field from being accessed but that's one possibility.

Yes you can absolutely insert a signature box and send and you can specify the location of it as well, either manually through the Console or programtically through the API.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say you can't ""save"" both recipients, however I have a feeling that you're issue is related to memory management of the recipients array.  You're allocating space for a size 1 array on every pass of the for-loop with the line 
 
envelope.Recipients.Recipient = new DSAPIService.Recipient[1];
 
So I think after the for-loop runs you're left with two separate recipient arrays, each of size 1.  What happens if you move the array allocation outside (above) the for-loop and make it size 2?  Can you try testing that let us know please?...

The details:  I'm working on an integration with DocuSign's REST API, currently testing the integration with demo.docusign.net. So far, we're able to create envelopes with the REST API just fine, emails go out to recipients, and they're able to sign those test documents on DocuSign. Our DocuSign admin panel shows the test documents as complete when both parties sign--that all works as expected.   What we'd like is to have DocuSign Connect push a notification to our API when someone signs the document.  Based on the PDF on Connect, I've been testing by POSTing the sample connect service message (from DocuSign_Connect_Service_Guide.pdf, page 12-13) to our API.   I can POST this test data from my external machine, from several different networks, and it works.  On POSTing, I see both web server log entries and that our own API is able to write a diagnostic document containing the body of the POST.  (This is intentional: I want to see what, exactly, DocuSign Connect sends at each step of the process.) When I go through the envelope creation and signing process through the demo.docusign.net sandbox, the envelope is created, the DocuSign API responds as expected, and emails go out as expected.  The signing process works as expected, but there is no evidence of DocuSign Connect actually trying to connect to our machine. There are no diagnostic files on our API server containing the body of the POST.  (There are when I hit our API with a POST from an external machine.)There are no log entries on our API server for the times when the we created the envelopes, DocuSign sent the emails, the documents were signed, and the envelopes completed. (There are when we POST from our dev machines.)There are no log entries of Connect attempts under the Logs tab at https://demo.docusign.net/Member/MemberEnvelopeIntegration.aspxThere are no log entries of failed Connect attempts under the Failures tab at https://demo.docusign.net/Member/MemberEnvelopeIntegration.aspxSince Connect doesn't seem to be trying to connect to our server, let's take a look at our Connect settings.  Mike B at DocuSign tells me that it looks like we're doing everything right:  In our Connect settings (at https://demo.docusign.net/Member/MemberEnvelopeIntegration.aspx), I've added a custom configuration, which now has its own tab.  URL to publish to: [our API address; it is secure, and it's a real domain name, not just IP numbers]Name: [we gave it a name which shows up in its custom tab.]Allow Envelope Publish is checked.Log enabled.Include Documents *not* checked. (We don't really need the documents themselves--just the envelope id and status info.)Require Acknowledgement *not* checked. (Should it be?)Sign Message with X509 Certificate checked.Use SOAP interface *not* checked.Include Time zone info checked.Include Sender Account as Custom Field checked.I have everything checked under ""Send information on these envelope events"" and ""Send information on these recipient events."" Of course, I've also saved these settings.  What, if anything else, needs to be done to get Connect to, well, connect?  Thanks!M";1355;8;mrickard;0;question;connect

I'm still learning DocuSign Connect myself and I'm not exactly an expert on it, but hopefully I can help you resolve this issue in a timely manner.  For starters, only because I do not see you mention anything about ports, I want to make sure that you are using the correct one(s).  I saw from this previous post here that DocuSign Connect will only send notifications on port 80 if using http, and port 443 for https.  I would like to think you're using those ports since you mention everything works when you POST from your external machine, but just wanted to confirm that first before looking into other areas...
 
Thanks,
-Ergin

Port 443 is active and accessible, and I've supplied an https address as the URL in the DocuSign Connect interface.   I'd think that if DocuSign Connect tried to connect but couldn't, there'd be an entry somewhere in the Failure log in my Connect Settings area, but there's no entry of any kind there.   Any ideas?

I just read the following in the Connect PDF Guide:
 
Require Acknowledgement: Select this option to log posting failures. The acknowledgement failure messages are logged in the Failures tab. When this option is selected, DocuSign will automatically attempt to repost any failures. Alternately, the customer can manually repost from the Failures tab. See the Publish Failures section for more information.
 
So I think that's why you're not seeing any failures listed.  Can you please enable that option to see if they start getting logged, which will hopefully provide some more info as to what the problem is?..

The content of the Logs tab is just ""No logs saved"" and the content of Failures is ""You currently have no envelopes that have failed to publish."" Could it be that there's some necessary step one has to take in order to have Connect follow the settings for a custom integration and not, say Salesforce?

I'm also using HAProxy, and it's set up to force connections to 443. What's baffling to me is that there aren't any entries in Failures on the DocuSign side, even with the Require Acknowledgement checked, and nothing in our API logs.  If Connect managed to publish the envelope, but our server dropped it, I'd expect to see a log entry on our side (or at least a Log entry on DocuSign, if Connect thought the connection occurred), but if it couldn't connect due to firewall issues, DNS issues, or something else, I'd expect a log entry for Failures on the DocuSign side.   The documents do go out for signing, so the API is triggering the emails...but Connect is not generating Log entries and is not generating Failure entries, even though I have Enable Log checked, Allow Envelope Publish checked, and Require Acknowledgement checked under our custom integration settings.  (Edit: I've toggled the X509 setting, and toggled the Include Documents setting, and there's no difference in behavior.) When one enables Connect, the default tab is for Salesforce, though one can also create a new custom, which is what I've done.  I have no information entered into the Salesforce tab, because we're not using a Salesforce integration. Is there some additional step one has to take in order to make Connect use the custom settings for Envelope Publish?   Is it possible that Connect first checks the Salesforce settings, and finding nothing there, ends the publishing process?  What if I create more than one custom configuration--how do I configure Connect to use one setting as opposed to another?  Or does Connect try all of them?  My suspicion is that for some reason, Connect doesn't see our custom configuration.

In either case, we very recently (last week) posted API walkthroughs in 3 more languages on our IODocs website located here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/
 
If you click on the API Walkthrough located at the top right of that page it will take you to the 9 walkthroughs we have, where we have PHP, Javascript, and now C#, Java, and Python samples illustrating the most common API use cases.  The C# and Java samples in particular use the XML format, while the PHP, Javascript, and Python samples demostrate JSON.  
 
Let me know what language you're using so I can try to answer your json specific question regarding multiple arrays.  And please also have a look at these samples to see if they help at all.

It sounds like you are trying to correct a recipient but the exact recipient string that you are specifying can't be found in the envelope possibly?  
 
There's a function that you can call to query recipient information on an envelope, I'd start by calling that to ensure the recipients that you think are in there are indeed there and that they are spelled how you'd expect.  The function you want to call is GetRecipientList() and more info on it can be found here:

A couple of things that could help debugging this - can you actually get the XML of your correction?  The code that you have posted can't be easily parsed or re-run on our end.
 
Second - can you call RequestStatusEx right before you do a correction?  That way we can see the exact list of recipients right before you make the call.

Using multiple templates in the same envelope is a relatively new feature that I don't know too much about yet, I'm wondering what happens if you move both templates into the composite templates section and give them sequence 1 and 2.  So, instead of having the templateId at the root level of the JSON what happens if you remove that and specify it as another server template, so that you have something like:
 
""compositeTemplates"": [ { ""serverTemplates"": [ { ""sequence"": ""1"", ""templateId"": ""SERVER_TEMPLATE_1"" },
{""sequence"": ""2"",""templateId"": ""SERVER_TEMPLATE_2""} ] } ]
 
Can you please give that a try and let us know?

And please try that for both of your templates (i.e. create two new templates and test with those)

To be honest I'm not too familiar with our SOAP API (I'm know REST better), nor do I know too much about SFDC integration, however I'm wondering if there is an issue with the logic of your for-loop.
 
I see that you are looping through this personInfoList object and at the end of each iteration you set your tabs with 
 
envelope.Tabs.Tab[i] = tab1;envelope.Tabs.Tab[i+1]= tab2;
 
Since your for-loop increments i by 1 each loop by doing i++, doesn't that mean that you will overwrite one of your tabs on each iteration?  So on the first iteration when i is 0, the 0th and 1st indexes of your tabs array get assigned, but then on the next iteration i becomes 1 and then the 1st and 2nd indexes of your tabs array get assigned, overwriting one of the previous elements.  Could that possibly be the issue or am I mis-reading that?

For example, let's say that we have a document called 'Document_A' that needs to be signed by one person, but the exact same Document_A needs to be signed by 3 people for some legal requirements. I am getting the data in the controller and storing them in a list named PersonInfoList. Of course, I made this list accesible on the page: public List<Person_Info__c> personInfoList{get;set;} I know the controller is working because if I hard-code the values, i receive the email corresponding email and the PDF is correctly generated).

Does the PDF document that you are using have anchor strings AND Form Fields inside it?  (form fields are the generic Adobe text boxes)  If so, I believe there might be a bug currently in the system related to PDF documents that contain both anchor strings and form fields, and the anchor strings not being recognized when the doc is sent.  Please let me know if your document contains both of them.

I think in general the answer is Yes- you can probably achieve what you want do if you are trying to allow users to sign an image file and upload it to a server somewhere.  However the way that DocuSign works is that it uses emails to send documents (or your image file) to recipients, that's how the system sends links to the users and is part of the legal process.";987;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Let's say you have your image file that was created through your app, you could send that file in a signature request to one or more recipients and they would be able to view it in the DocuSign Console and sign any signature tabs that you added to the document.  And you can set it to go to recipients in order (i.e. one person signs, then it gets sent to the next for their signature, or you can have it sent them at the same time, etc.)
 
Have you seen our IODocs website?  It has 2 great tools for helping developers gets started with the REST API.  On that site we have an API Explorer, where you can plug in your information and make test calls and see the resulting requests and responses.  We also have a very useful API Walkthroughs page which has 9 common use cases of our API.  Based on what you're describing you should look at API Walkthrough #4 - Request Signature Document.  In that walkthrough they show you how to send a PDF file for signature, all you would do is replace the PDF file with your image file and change the content format to jpg, png, etc.
 
The API Explorer can be found here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/
 
The API Walkthroughs can be found here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthroughs
 
And once again API Walkthrough #4 is here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/requestSignatureFromDocument
 
[EDIT]
 
Actually, I forgot that you mentioned you do not want to email the document links to people... this is also possible using our REST API.  We have something called ""Embedding"" where instead of sending an email to your users you can provide them with a URL where they can go to sign or send documents.  So if you have an external app or website, through there your users can open the document for sending or signing in a seamless fashion (so that they don't know they're leaving your site).  This would accomplish the ""not sending an email"" portion of your app.
 
The last 3 API Walkthroughs demonstrate Embedded Sending, Embedded Signing, and Embedded DocuSign (i.e. open the Console from the start):

In the REST API Guide I just read this:  Tabs are associated with a specific recipient in an envelope and are only used by the recipient types In Person Signers and Signers.
 
Which page in the API documentation are you referring to where you saw tabs being added separate from a recipient?

In your code it looks like you are assigning this tab to the same recipient that the signature tab goes through, so I don't think it's a visibility/access issue.  I'm wondering if there's something about the anchor string that's throwing it off.  As a test, can you try using X, Y positions instead of an anchor string for the SSN tab, to see if that makes a difference?

We are attempting to have one administrator account that we will store the credentials for. For all the other users we will only store their email and use their emails along with the administrators' credentials to use the send on behalf of feature. We are running into problems with using the Rest API Version 2 and Embedded Sending. When we make the rest call to get the Embedded Sending URL with the send on behalf of users email along with the administrators' credentials we receive a 401 response: One or Both of Username and Password are invalid. If we remove the send on behalf of users email from the authorization credentials, we receive a URL, however the URL is not for the Embedded Signing page. The URL instead is for the administrators' login page, with it on the 'Manage' tab. After investigating I noticed that the administrators' account can't view envelops in the users draft folder. Since the envelope is saved in the draft folder before it is tagged and sent, I have a hunch this is why we are not direct to the Embedded Sending page when we request the URL. I think it is worth pointing out that we are able to do Embedded Signing using only the administrators' credentials to retrieve the URL through the Rest API Version 2 interface.

Sending on behalf of others is a relatively new feature so we might have a little back on forth on this issue before we have resolution, but one thing I'm curious about- what envelope status are you supplying in your request?

Acting As Other Account UsersDepending on the account holder, a DocuSign account can support a number of individual users. Some client application integrations, especially those installed in other multi-user environments (such as Salesforce, Dynamics, SugarCRM) have the option to store login information for each of the client application users or to designate a single user as the ""authenticating user"", who will authenticate for other users in the account. This allows a client application to store less information about individual DocuSign users and also avoid requesting password information for each user of the client application.A user, known as the authenticating user in this circumstance, that wants to authenticate for other users in the account must have the following DocuSign userSettings enabled:apiAccountWideAccessallowSendOnBehalfOfNote: If you are setting user permissions through the DocuSign web console, these correspond to the Account-Wide Rights and Send On Behalf Of Rights (API) settings.The two methods of for acting as other users are described below:Acting as Other Account UsersNote: This provides functionality that is identical to the ""Send On Behalf Of"" feature.This allows an authenticating user to act as another user in the account. The operations, usually sending an envelope or checking status, are performed as the ""operating user,"" not as the authenticating user. The authenticating user's access_token is used for authentication only, while the ""operating user's"" userId is checked for proper authorization for the API method being called. This allows the client application to avoid storing any tokens for individual users.To act as other account users, the client application specifies the operating user by adding the ""X-DocuSign-Act-As-User"" header to the request. For example:GET https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId} Authorization: bearer <access token for authenticating user>X-DocuSign-Act-As-User: bob.smith@gmail.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/json The syntax email:name is also supported in the <SendOnBehalfOf> node in the ""X-DocuSign-Authentication"" header.";1035;N/A;ebvigmo;0;answer;N/A

The following explains how to get SOBO (Send On Behalf Of) functionality working using the REST API:
 
You need to use our oAuth enpoints to first obtain the proper access tokens, then you put one of those access tokens into the call where you are making a call on behalf of another user in the same account.  You do NOT use the X-DocuSign-Authentication header when making such a request.
 
Here's what I did to get it to work.  In this example User1 will be sending on behalf of User2:
 
1)  Obtain a user access token for User1.  To get this do the following:
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/token
 
(headers)Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
(body)grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={email}&password={password}&scope=api
 
When successful you will receive an access_token in the response body, let's say it is the value ""11111"".
 
2)  Obtain a user access token on behalf of User2
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/tokenAuthorization: bearer 11111Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={$emailOnBehalf}&password={password}&scope=api
 
Note that the email used in the line above, $emailOnBehalf, is the email address of User2 (the user will send on behalf of).  Let's say that the access_token that is returned from this call is ""22222"".
 
3)  Send signature request on behalf of User2:
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/accounts/{ACCOUNTID}/envelopesAuthorization: bearer 22222
X-DocuSign-Act-As-User: $emailOnBehalfAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=MYBOUNDARY
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
<request body goes here>
 
In this third call please note the Authorization header and the X-DocuSign-Act-As-User header, which contains the email address for User2.  I just tested this all out and it works...

You need to send a PUT request and if you look at the sample JSON it's MUCH simpler than what you are sending out.  I just tested it and got it to work. 
 
I did my test in PHP and found this page on the net very helpful for making PUT requests through PHP:

The contacts that are being returned are:All private contacts for the user Shared contacts that fit the conditions outlined in my first post.If a user is added to the account, say Joe Smith, he is automatically added to shared contacts for the account, and is visible any time the user opens the address book in DocuSign itself.

The name of the variable makes me wonder if custom tabs or custom fields would work in your envelope if you included them, not sure on that.  For reference sake, custom tabs can be added through the Console UI or the API and are custom tabs that you can add for given recipients.  Custom fields, on the other hand, are at the envelope level (instead of recipient level).
 
In either case, looking through GitHub it seems the only source file that contains the CustomFields_type_info member is DSAPI.cls.  I see it referenced 6 times in that file, what happens if you un-comment those lines?  Does the warning go away?

Send what you are sending though iodocs. That will get you going.
 
Passing an arbritary set may give you that error.

We can not tell why one gets a given error by seeing that a function call does indeed get triggered. We really need to see what is actually being passed to the server. 
 
 
For example, from where I am sitting, I can not tell if you are passing an envelope id, or a well formed envelope id, or if you are going against demo.docusign.net. I see that you are referencing an envelopeId identifier, but can not tell if it is even a well-formed identifier.
 
It wold be helpful if you can capture the http packets that are being sent so that we can see what is being sent to the server.

I am writing some software that will batch process our DocuSign templates with the primary purpose of replacing custom Text tabs (whose label follows certain naming conventions) with SignHere tabs. The first problem is that the coordinates for the new SignHere tab (copied directly from the original Custom Text tab) do not show up in the Management console (under Properties/Location) identically; they have had their coordinate system changed somehow, eg (95,469) becomes (198,978).  I saw another similar question that was answered by saying that this is a result of differences between the original PDF's DPI and the DocuSign standard DPI of 72.  I have Acrobat Professional and there is no mention of DPI in my document, nor does Google have any information (that I have seen) that suggests that any PDF has a 'standard' DPI -- it appears that DPI is chosen as a part of the PDF rendering process (be it to a printer or the screen) and is not intrinsic to the PDF document itself. The second problem is that when I then Request the modified template, the XPosition and YPosition, while back to what appears to be their original coordinate system, have been translated by some amounts, mostly in the Y direction, though the XPosition is usually off by a couple.  The Y translation (towards the bottom) is exactly 42 in the web-based viewer coordinates and around 32 in the original Tab coordinate system. Note that I have performed an identical transform to Date Tabs with perfect accuracy, though that looks like a text-to-text transformation as opposed to a text-to-image transform required for SignHere. This processing software I'm writing is essential to our being able to cope with updates to the source documents (ie: manual SignHere placement is not feasible), but I'm very leary of putting some sort of fudge factor into the placement of the SignHere and Initial tabs.";965;N/A;rwmccall;0;answer;N/A

While I will make sure to note that this feature is only supported in the v2 API, it would also be helpful to point out where an up-to-date resource is on tabs. http://cl.ly/image/15040O1O3o18;988;N/A;wintondeshong;0;answer;N/A

Are you on the latest build, which is 3.11.2?
 
If you are still on an older build and don't want to or can't upgrade, then there is a workaround (although a very cumbersome one):
 - create the template per normal
 - download as XML
 - upload the XML into a new template (with a new template ID)

It doesn't matter which language you use to do this as long as it can send http requests.  The walkthroughs I forwarded to you illustrate how to do this in 5 sample languages.
 
If you open the template in your screenshot you'll see that it has a templateId.  You need to use that templateId in your API request, just like the walkthrough I gave you does...

This should be easy to achieve, you would simply create a signature request from a document or from a template and in your request body you would add X many recipients of type in-person signer.  
 
Have you read the Features section of the Dev Center?  There's a page devoted to recipient types that also links to the REST API guide for more information on them.  
 
Also, we have two great tools to help you get started.  You can make test API calls without writing a single line of code through the API Explorer.  You can test out by sending a request with a few test in-person signers (if you want you can use your email address but a different name for each and the system will identify them as different recipients) to see how the flow would work.
 
We also have the API Walkthroughs which have sample code written in 5 languages that show you how to make requests etc.

Goal:
In Salesfroce (SFDC)  using trigger (and helper class) which calls docusign web service we need to send a document  to recipient.  Document source is DocuSign Templates.
Writing the class I used the following link:
http://developer.force.com/cookbook/recipe/accessing-docusign-api-from-salesforcecom-to-send-contrac...
Did everything , loaded WSDL and created the class DocuSignAPI.
What we have now:

}
 
This class creates and sends to the email:  ""recipient.Email = contact.Email"" an email with a body  ""envelope.EmailBlurb = 'Bady'"" and subject  ""envelope.Subject = 'Subject'"" 
For testing purposes the document itself is a SFDC Visual Page PDF:  '/apex/test2'
 
In our case the document have to be taken from DocuSign Template.  And this is a main issue because I can not find any related to this information. As mentioned in DocuSign Forum
http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-Ruby-Salesforce-and-Other/Adding-email-mes...

Request result:
baseUrl = https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/accounts/279584
accountId = 279584
Error calling webservice, status is: 400
 
I took the example from here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/requestSignatureFromTemplate#java
But as you can see the request returns unknown error on DocuSign API side.
Please advise me how to solve the issue taking in account that the main issue is how to attach (call) the DocuSign Template in my helper class to send it to recipient.
Will really appreciate the help and respond.

First I recommend searching the SOAP API guide for ""template"":
http://www.docusign.com/developer-center/documentation
 
Next, even though it's for REST, the API Walkthroughs will still give you a good idea for how to reference templates in your request:

Lastly, they are older links, but I believe we have soap walkthroughs up on GitHub:

Please tell us what is confusing you in this text and we will fix it.Also, what language do you develop in? In general we don't have all scenarios covered in all technology stacks, but we try our best to have ready made code for you. We generally meet someone who can read and understand C-like language syntax and can find our Java and .NET samples useful.3.5Anchor Based TaggingThis section outlines the usage rules and behaviors of the DocuSign Anchor-Based Tagging feature. Anchor-Based Tagging enables a DocuSign customer to send documents for signature that do not have a fixed layout or format. In these documents, you can not anticipate the absolute location of the tabs when you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text. As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs, the DocuSign Signing Service derives anchor tab locations by correlating XML instructions from the SOAP request to data within the document.3.5.1Using Anchor TabsAnchor tab solutions require a coordinated map between the Anchor data and the document(s) in the CreateEnvelope/CreateAndSendEnvelope SOAP request. When the DocuSign Signing Service receives a request that contains anchor tabs, it searches the document for instances of the AnchorTabString. When found, it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient. Tab positions are established by committing the Anchor offset values relative to the lower left point of the AnchorTabString. When you apply tabs to the document, DocuSign does not remove or replace the AnchorTabString. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. While the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes, it will not be visible on the document. To create an anchor tab:1.Identify the location in the document by text string. Use either a preexisting text string or add a new one. For example, ""Borrower's Signature"" might already exist in the document. If not, you could add the text string, ""BorrowersSignHere"".2.Reference the anchor through the AnchorTabString element of the SOAP request of the CreateEnvelope/CreateAndSendEnvelope request.3.Determine the offset from the AnchorTabString location to where the tab should be placed. The bottom-left of the AnchorTabString is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that. Positive XOffset values move the tab right on the page and positive YOffset values move the tab up on the page.DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.";1796;N/A;RussAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

is subject to change as we evolve the system:
DocuSign Web Services API 3.0 SDKThe DocuSign Web Services 
API provides methods that allow developers to integrate the DocuSign service 
into their applications. By building DocuSign into existing applications, those 
applications gain the ability to gather electronic signatures and data. 
Transactions are completely defined on the host application side by 
generating XML envelopes that contain a PDF and the XML signing instructions. 
Because the transactions could be defined on the fly by the host application, 
the workflow and processing can be completely defined by the 
developer.The service allows developers to build solutions that are able 
to perform the following -* Send documents for signature through the web 
service from host applications either one at a time, or as a group in an 
electronic envelope* Define the authentication required to sign or access 
the envelope including 3 different types, or pass through authentication from 
the host application* Define the signature locations using either static or 
relative signature location descriptions on any page in the document* Define 
data field locations, masks, and if they are optional or required, and if they 
contain pre-populated data if those fields are locked or editable.* Assign 
specific signing tasks or data fields to specific individuals* Support 
embedded signing where the signing process is invoked with a token that allows 
the signing to be embedded in an iframe of a host application* Support 
remote signing where the signing process generates an email to return to 
sign* Select the workflow the routing of signing either in parallel or in 
serial or a combination* Submit completely specified envelopes that are 
immediately processed for delivery. * Submit partially specified envelopes 
for later completion by the customer.* Void an envelope that has been 
submitted but not yet completed.* Retrieve the status of an envelope 
including sent, signed, voided, forwarded, etc.* Retrieve the digitally 
signed completed PDF of every document in an envelope.* Retrieve the 
completed PDF for each separate document in an envelope.* Retrieve the 
e-sign status of a recipient.* Retrieve the certificate and audit log of the 
transaction* Transfer an envelope to another DocuSign user or account.* 
Correct recipient information for an existing envelope.* Resend a 
notification email to an existing recipient.* Correct the workflow for 
envelopes have already been submitted* Retrieve the Member level permissions 
for the optional features.* Turn on or off the envelope ID stamp* 
Retrieve data entered by signers filling in the data fields. * Submit 
documents for signature without any signing tabs at all, which invokes a 
freeform signing process that the recipient will follow to place signatures* 
Specify electronic vaulting for Envelopes.* Exract and remove original 
copies of documents from the DocuSign systems.In order to help 
developers get started with the Web Services API, we have developed sample code 
and documentation for .NET and Java environments. The SDK includes:- 
Documentation- Web Service Description File (WSDL)- Samples in Java and 
.NETNOTE: You will need to contact DocuSign in order to get a development 
account which is required to run the samples.System requirements for 
Microsoft(r) samples:- Visual Studio 2005 (with applicable system

I noticed that in the example, the template is being pulled down, filled in, and then sent back up through a document in an envelope. This works in my solution as well, and when I call RequestTemplate, I have includeDocumentBytes set to true.  However, our templates are very large and this call can take a long time to process. Also when I call CreateEnvelope, I must sent back the entire document, which contains the large amount of PDFBytes, thus taking a long time on this call as well.  I tried not including the bytes, but this caused the SOAP request to fail, because it didn't have the PDF header. I'm wondering if there is an alternate API call where I could just send the data I need to update, along with perhaps the template ID I want that data to go into, and then the function call handles the rest?  Does such a function exist, or is the only way to upload data into a template via the CreateEnvelope (or CreateAndSendEnvelope) call? Thanks :);1025;2;eclarizio;1;question;includeDocumentBytes. ruby
12/01/2011 13:00:00;;129.1;Re: DocumentBytes Necessary?;http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-Ruby-Salesforce-and-Other-READ-ONLY/DocumentBytes-Necessary/td-p/1569;"Great question! The way our samples are set up demonstrates one way to do things -- and may not be what you want.
 
One of the benefits of using templates is not having to pass around lots of documents. You can use server templates (ones that exist on your account) without ever downloading it to your system. And yes, you can just send the data you need to update, along with the recipients' information. That particular function call is ""CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates."" While you can use local templates, it is much more common for people to use server templates.
 
Take a look at this blog entry about how to add values to templates. While the code is in Apex, you can easily see how it maps back to Ruby.
 
Just a quick caveat:
 
When creating your template, it is tempting to put in all information you can about your recipients. Don't do this! Instead, just specify a role for each recipient. Then, when you create the recipient's info in code, make sure you use the role name that you specified in the template. That will match that recipient to all the tabs/secure fields you had created.

Hopefully if anyone else is using this function my comments will help (I hope these spoiler tags work, they don't seem to work in the preview mode): First, Ruby's version of the ArrayOfRecipient1, and ArrayOfTemplateReferenceRoleAssignment are different than Apex.  Here is Apex's version: Spoiler (Highlight to read) DocuSignAPI.ArrayOfRecipient1 signers = new DocuSignAPI.ArrayOfRecipient1();signers.Recipient = new DocuSignAPI.Recipient[1];signers.Recipient[0] = recipient; DocuSignAPI.ArrayOfRecipient1 signers = new DocuSignAPI.ArrayOfRecipient1();signers.Recipient = new DocuSignAPI.Recipient[1];signers.Recipient[0] = recipient;Ruby declares a new ArrayOfRecipient1, but then instead just directly adds the recipients to that object, instead of the recipient parameter of that object.  Like so: Spoiler (Highlight to read) docusign_recipients = Docusign::ArrayOfRecipient1.newdocusign_recipients << recipient docusign_recipients = Docusign::ArrayOfRecipient1.newdocusign_recipients << recipient I also noticed that the Apex version of the actual function call includes 4 parameters, and when run in Ruby, it complained that I was giving it 4 parameters instead of 1.  Looking at the documentation in the API Guide on CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates, and then looking at the php code, it as well was only using 1 parameter.  I modeled my code after the php code and wound up with something like this: Spoiler (Highlight to read)  docusign_env_from_temp_params = Docusign::CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates.newdocusign_env_from_temp_params.activate_envelope = falsedocusign_env_from_temp_params.envelope_information = docusign_envelopedocusign_env_from_temp_params.template_references = docusign_template_ref_arraydocusign_env_from_temp_params.recipients = docusign_recipients#Now we can send the paramsresponse = connection.create_envelope_from_templates(docusign_env_from_temp_params)    docusign_env_from_temp_params = Docusign::CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates.newdocusign_env_from_temp_params.activate_envelope = falsedocusign_env_from_temp_params.envelope_information = docusign_envelopedocusign_env_from_temp_params.template_references = docusign_template_ref_arraydocusign_env_from_temp_params.recipients = docusign_recipients#Now we can send the paramsresponse = connection.create_envelope_from_templates(docusign_env_from_temp_params)   This definitely cut the time it took for the call to complete!  Originally, using CreateEnvelope, it was taking about 50 seconds, because our templates are huge.  With this call, it's down to about 12 seconds, which is excellent. Also, about your caveat, I think our templates were already set up like this, and when I read it, I thought ""well wait a second I still need to put information in the recipient object...""  Reading it again, I understand you meant in the Docusign Member dashboard thing while you're actually creating the template. I was also getting some strange error: Spoiler (Highlight to read) SOAP::FaultError (Validation error: If the 'nillable' attribute is false in the schema, the 'xsi:nil' attribute must not be present in the instance.):  SOAP::FaultError (Validation error: If the 'nillable' attribute is false in the schema, the 'xsi:nil' attribute must not be present in the instance.):  The problem was that I was not setting a required field somewhere in the recipient, I believe it was either the type or the require_id_lookup.  I looked at the API Guide again, but I can't tell which fields are required and which are optional.  After looking at the schema diagram, it appears the dashed line ones are optional, while the solid line ones are required.  However, I have not specified an access_code on my recipient, and the API call still functions properly.  Perhaps the API Guide is not as up to date as the actual API?  Edit: Whoa the spoilers totally crazed out! Hopefully they're fixed so they're not nested anymore";895;N/A;eclarizio;3;answer;N/A

While web service limits payloads to 3MB, it looks like you're running into possibley a heap size problem. I see a couple of things to try:
 
1. Execute getHeapSize and getLimitHeapSize in the method that's failing to see if you have enough heap space to grab that document. If that's the limiting factor, there may be ways for you to reduce the heap used by other objects in your method call.
 
2. Is there a way to split the document into several and have them all in the same envelope? You can then use RequestDocumentPDFs to get the document in pieces.";1124;N/A;craigatdocusign;0;answer;N/A

In particular, when I used eDL to blast a bunch of my Outlook Contacts to my DocuSign online Address Book, there was often latency with regard to when these changes showed up.  Sometimes it would take a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes and sometimes a few hours (ouch!).  To be precise, the SOAP request being used is/was an UpdateAddressBookItems. Has anyone out there seen this problem?  If so, is there anything being done to address this?  As I recall from the previous time this issue was raised, I believe it was confirmed that the DocuSign Address Book employs a caching algorithm, which might account for the latency. Also, one other bit of information ... After the current customer completed the operations using eDL, he tried to access his Address Book through the DocuSign web console and he received a error message saying it was ""unavailable"".  After a period of time, access was restored and all the address book entries created using eDL were there (?). Regards and thanks in advance, Duke";641;3;atware;0;question;UpdateAddressBookItems ...

If our SQL database is very busy, the address book items from a batch transfer can ""trickle"" into a users address book instead of appear all at once. This occurs because we cache the incoming request, then treat each address item as a separate transaction. Is it possible that this is the behavior your users are seeing?";529;N/A;craigatdocusign;0;answer;N/A

This *might* explain it, although I don't think the requests are being ""batched"".  Instead, I think there is (or can be) many individual UpdateAddressBookItems requests strung together.  It depends upon how many Outlook Contacts are being synchronized. This brings up the following questions: 1) Do you folks plan to change this dynamic, or is this the way it will always be?  In an ideal world, updating Address Book Entries would be no different than any other database write operation (i.e., no latency).  Using caching suggests that the Address Book data is of lesser importance, which may be true. 2) Is there a way to query the ""busy status"" of the AB through the API?  Given this behavior, a good fall back position would be to query the AB to warn the user if and when update operations are pending. Thanks, Duke";510;N/A;atware;0;answer;N/A

Although FTP probably shouldn't be used for this purpose due to security, etc. there might be some good cases for it. Below is a PHP script that will receive envelope XML from DocuSign Connect and upload all enclosed PDFs to an FTP server. Edit on 2011/03/11:I just updated this with some fixes.  It now properly handles multiple PDFs in an envelope.  Before I didn't use children() on the DocumentPDFs element so I was only seeing one of them.  Logging was also slightly incorrect and that now works properly.  Additionally the script now uploads a copy of the original XML to the FTP server named with the envelope ID. <?php/** * This script demonstrates how envelope documents published to a receiving * server could then be uploaded to an FTP server.

We recently made a change to require an integrator key on all API calls. When constructing your username for the soap proxy, you will need to incorporate your integrator key as such:
 
[integrator key]username
 
You can read more about the integrator key in this blog entry.
 
Now, the request statuses call takes a filter, which does take the account ID. You will still want to use just the account ID there.

We do have a role, called an Agent, who can review the envelope and assign signers. However, the Agent cannot sign so if you want the manager to both sign and specify signers, they would have to be on the envelope twice.
 
Check out this blog entry on the Agent feature.
 
However, agents must be assigned an email address. Therefore, it might be best to have someone who knows the chain of command to be the agent, and assign all signers at once.
 
You could also drop the signers into an ""advanced correct"" experience.

At the moment it simply returns to the embed page itself, which is obviously bad form. I've worked to integrate Docusign into a CodeIgniter library, and shuffled certain functions under more generic ones to keep implementation simple. I have a send() method within my Docusign class which looks like this:   $this->createEnvelope($first_name, $last_name, $email, $subject, $content); $this->envelope->Envelope->Tabs = $this->tabs; $_envelope = $this->api->CreateAndSendEnvelope($this->envelope); $this->envelopeid = $_envelope->CreateAndSendEnvelopeResult->EnvelopeID; $this->getEmbedCode($this->envelopeid, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);  I assume I've been doing this right - the envelope is created, I append my ""tabs"" to the document, the envelop is sent, I grab the ID of the envelop and then ""get the embed code"". The getEmbedCode() is a custom method. It simply looks like this:   function getEmbedCode($envelopeid, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $http_host) { $_requestrecipienttoken = $this->makeRequestRecipientToken($envelopeid, $first_name, $last_name, $email, $http_host); $_requestrecipienttokenresponse = $this->api->RequestRecipientToken($_requestrecipienttoken); $this->embedtoken = $_requestrecipienttokenresponse->RequestRecipientTokenResult; }  Later on I access the embed token via the Docusign class and grabbing the embedtoken value, which is set at the end of getEmbedCode(). However, after signing the document and sending it along, the user is still sent to just the embed page again, though without the docusign document embedded. makeRequestRecipientToken() does contain the code to append ClientURLs to the $RequestRecipientToken object, which is returned from makeRequestRecipientToken(), and thusly assigned to $_requestrecipienttoken. I can exit the script after a var_dump and see my $RequestRecipientToken object has a ClientURLs object on it with all the appropriate values entered. Actually the script complains if one of those values (OnTTLExpired, OnCancel, OnDecline, etc) are missing. So what am I doing wrong? This is the last hurdle to get this implementation working and I've been working on it for a number of days now. Any help is appreciated.";1264;4;JamesLai;0;question;

It's a bit hard to reconstruct what some of your functions and subroutines are doing.  Is there any chance you can provide a trace of the RequestRecipientToken call as well as the URL where you are calling things from.

   $RequestRecipientToken->ClientUserID = session_id();
   $RequestRecipientToken->Username = $_POST[""FirstName""]."" "".$_POST[""LastName""];
   $RequestRecipientToken->Email = $_POST[""Email""];

 // an authentication assertion is a statement by the hosting code (i.e. this code) to docusign that

   $RequestRecipientToken->AuthenticationAssertion->AuthenticationInstant = makeISO8601Date();
   $RequestRecipientToken->AuthenticationAssertion->AuthenticationMethod = ""Password"";
   $RequestRecipientToken->AuthenticationAssertion->SecurityDomain = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

 // Client URLS indicate where the signing session will redirect to when it is finished - because the user

It's a bit hard to reconstruct what some of your functions and subroutines are doing.  Is there any chance you can provide a trace of the RequestRecipientToken call as well as the URL where you are calling things from.

Also a fair warning that the redirect happens within the IFRAME.  We don't break out of the IFRAME for you, but you can do it with a simple JavaScript.

Now I want template fields to be pre filled with the values from related SFDC fields.Here is a method I'm using now to pass and fill up the fields in the document using JSON:
{
  ""emailSubject"": ""e1231231231231231"",
  ""emailBlurb"": ""adadasdasdasdadadadad"",
  ""templateId"": ""777A4511-6B99-4646-927E-CF840BC68320"",
  ""templateRoles"": [
    {
      ""tabs"": {
        ""textTabs"": [
          {
            ""tabLabel"": ""Booking Name"",
            ""value"": ""Name""
          },
          {
            ""tabLabel"": ""Company Name"",

      ""name"": ""ADASDasd"",
      ""email"": ""zxc@zxc.com""
    }
  ]
}

But REST API  does not have enough information about JSON settings and  I met a few issues there:
1. I can't pass fields with following data types:  Checkbox i Drop Down Data. Any particular syntax for such fields?
 2. The template use the same field on different pages. For instance SFDC field  ""Booking Name"" used 3 times with the same label:  Booking Name
If I'm passing this value:
""templateRoles"": [
    {
      ""tabs"": {
        ""textTabs"": [
          {
            ""tabLabel"": ""Booking Name"",
            ""value"": ""Name""

Ok so I've been testing and what I've found is that if you give the textTabs the same tabLabel they do indeed update as you type data into them, but you're right in that only the first tab starts out with the initial data.  I will log a bug for this.
 
For the checkbox/drop down question, please read the Rest API Guide as it explains how to do this.  For instance, this page explains the checkbox tab type.  You need to set ""selected"" to ""true"".  The drop down is slightly more complicated so read it's page please:
 
""checkboxTabs"": [{
  ""tabLabel"": ""CheckBox"",
  ""selected"": ""true""

Engineering got back to me through the bug I logged for your second issue, this is actually working as designed.  If you have several tabs with the same tabLabel and you'd like all of them to start out with the same initial value, such as your Booking Name tab, then you need to prefix your the tabLabel with the wildcard string \\* 
 
For instance, if you have 
 
""textTabs"": [
          {
            ""tabLabel"": ""\\*Booking Name"",
            ""value"": ""ABCDE""
          }
 
then all the fields that have Booking Name set for their tabLabel will start out with ABCDE.

If you set this up through the Connect settings under Preferences in the Console you can add your listener URL (as well as other settings) then you can enable logging, which should indicate where in the process it's failing.  
 
There's some posts in this forum if you search for ""DocuSign Connect"" and/or ""listeners"", for instance here's one.
 
And here's some general info (including the guide for Connect).  Once you get it to work through there you should be able to easily set up the envelope notifications...

Recently I ran into some issues with date field formats changing and not being able to make my currecy fields show up how I wanted them to in my documents.  To over come this I had to write formulas in salesforce then pull those into my Text Merge Fields in Docusign.  use Case 1-  Date field showing up as yyyy-mm-dd  need it to show up as dd/mm/yyyy The solution was taking my date field and creating a formula that looks like this. (IF(ISBLANK( Project_Delivery_Date__c), """", TEXT(MONTH( Project_Delivery_Date__c))+""/""+TEXT(DAY( Project_Delivery_Date__c))+""/""+TEXT(YEAR( Project_Delivery_Date__c)))) This is a text formula return so make sure that you make your formula a text and viola!  like a boss!  Another variation for todays date would be TEXT(MONTH( TODAY()))+""/""+TEXT(DAY( TODAY()))+""/""+TEXT(YEAR( TODAY()))  For currency fields I was having my $ stripped out as well as my commas to separate my 3 digit returns over a thousand.  so I was taking $1,000 and getting 1000.00.  So to over come this I wrote this in salesforce (also text return) and it worked like a charm. ""$""+ IF(Amount < 1000, TEXT(Amount), IF(Amount < 1000000, TEXT(FLOOR(Amount/1000)) & ',' & RIGHT(TEXT(Amount), 3), IF(Amount < 1000000000, TEXT(FLOOR(Amount/1000000)) & ',' & TEXT(FLOOR(MOD(Amount,1000000)/1000)) & ',' & RIGHT(TEXT(Amount), 3), "" ""))) Just substitute your currency field for Amount, or if its amout from the opty this should work fine.  Let me know if anyone has any use for these!  I also have some blogs on triggers that change Opps status from Docusign based on Template Status.  Ping me if you would like to know more!

That might be why, and also why it always shows as In Process.  Are you on purpose trying to do In-Person signing?  (With InPerson signing it means that you phyically pass whatever device your using to the person who is signing and they go through a process where they complete the signing and pass the device back to you).

To answer your question- you need to make a POST call to the /recipients URI to add recipients to an existing envelope.

If you are setting this callback into every envelope you are creating, you may want to examine the Connect Publisher, with documentation as seen here.
 
Essentially, you configure your account to publish the events that you care about -- in your case it is the Sent and Completed events -- and DocuSign with publish the information you request to you. You set up a listener to recieve the information and incorporate it back into your workflow. There unfortunately is not a sample listener in Ruby, but there is one in PHP.
 
The advantage of the Publisher is that there is less code to maintain. Also, should you ever need to change the publishing URL, you can do so in your DocuSign account and not have to change any code.";1704;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A

It shoud work.  It looks like you have tested the connectivity.  One way to do debug this further is to set up a Connect event posting. 
 
It's the same technology but it uses global account wide settings.

When you set up a connect post you should enable logging and see what you get.

What is your listener? The flow should be:
 
1) Create Envelope with paramters for callback
2) Use RequestRecipientToken to get the Embedded Signing iFrame URL
3) Direct the Signer to that URL
4) Signer finishes and is directed to your EventNotification URL

See Code Below it will not Activate the the EventNotification.  Secondly there is no option under Preferences for Logs what so ever that maybe on an older version? Why wouldn't any of the API documentation mention that you have do that step? But I cannot . Please see attachment.

Please notice that CreateAndSendEnvelope takes an Envelope structure and not an EnvelopeInformation structure.  If you change EnvelopeInformation to Envelope, you will see the EventNotification data in the SOAP request body. Sorry I missed that earlier. 
 
EnvelopeInformation structure is used by CreateEnvelopeFromTemplate().
 
Regarding DocuSign Connect: goto Preferences -> Features -> and go down to DocuSign API.  Please check DocuSign Connect.  This will enable Connect to appear under the Account Administration options.

Let's get the base functionality working, and after that you can make changes as appropriate.
 
1. Get our sample PHP running on a machine accessible on the INET
2. create a 'tmp' directory within the DocuSignSample directory and make sure that it has the right rw rights
3. point  eventNoti->URL to http://yourserver.com/DocuSignSample/connect.php
 
 
After you send the envelope:
1) go to logs and see that it has been delivered
the log will show the response as : 2/23/2012 6:37:39 PM  Response: Got Envelope ID: 85fb65bd-7fbb-4033-a4c5-ddae5caa83a4<br/>
This means that the xml has been received, processed, the envelopeId got retrieved, and returned in the http response.
2) go to http://yourserver.com/DocuSignSample/connect.php
this will display all the files from the tmp directory, and you should see the notification you received.
