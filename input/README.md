**Notes**
* Time-related features come in different formats. Check the [dump file formats page](https://github.com/collab-uniba/dataset_best-answers_emse/tree/master/dumps) for details before parsing.
* CSV files may contain more columns than those reported in Table 1. This is because some extra features (e.g., tags, number of answer views) were extracted but not eventually used  because not commonly available on all datasets.
