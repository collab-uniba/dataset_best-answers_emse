It looks like he uses webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest to check to see if the current URL of the page being rendered is the redirect_uri specified.  In that case, extract the authorization code from the URL and call the /token endpoint to get an access token.Alternatively, it looks like there's an OAuth client library for iOS that you can use.  Glancing at the README, it seems it would let you easily implement OAuth.Let me bring in josh from our team who has more experience with iOS and might have some thoughts here.On another note, it might make sense for you to handle the OAuth flow from a server, rather than directly from your client.  That is, instead of having your iOS app complete the second leg of OAuth and getting the access token directly, you would have an intermediary web application that would finish the last leg, get an access token, and store it.  There are two strengths to this approach:You won't need to store your application secret in your iOS app's code (where it could probably be compromised with some snooping around)Since access tokens expire hourly, and refresh tokens, which can be used to get new access tokens, expire every 60 days, you can have the server refresh access tokens periodically for you via a cron job.  That way, your application doesn't need to store any sensitive credentials, it will just ask the server to make API calls on its behalf.";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/dwolla-ios-iphone-sdk/699/613/11/14 04:45;;699.7;answer;;;0;Josh Aaseby (josh);;"You can find an example of using a UIWebView with our OAuth in our example iOS app on Github.

I'm saving the transaction id in my DB for that payment.As a note: scheduled payments will return a unique string identifier, which is a scheduled payment Id and not a transaction Id. However, once the scheduled transaction kicks off you can call Retrieve Scheduled Payment, passing in your scheduled payment Id, to get the transactionId of the created scheduled payment.    How to know the status of this scheduled transaction is success or failed or cancelled by the user from his dwolla account.You can check the status of a scheduled payment by calling Retrieve Scheduled Payment. Once the scheduled payment is created and there is a transactionId, you can either poll our API1 for the transaction status or rely on webhooks.    How the webhooks will work and how we can test the webhooks is working or not. I'm implementing using PHP.You can set up a TransactionStatus webhook and set your url to a requestb.in, then create a scheduled transaction for tomorrow.

My developer application requests the send and receive permissions, which causes me to forced through IVF only option. Tangentially related: is it possible that Dwolla will support the creation of scheduled payments without a verified bank? Where one could be notified through the app's callback URL that a scheduled payment didn't go through because the user never verified their bank account via microtransaction verification?The reason I ask is that building a service that solely uses the API endpoints specific to scheduled payments has a somewhat cumbersome workflow. Either they create an account with a verified bank, or: we (or our API's consumer) have to tell them to create an account, continually check if they've verified their bank account and if they have get them to come back and enter their pin to schedule the transaction, or if they haven't handle that case appropriately as well.";http://discuss.dwolla.com/t/new-accounts-and-scheduled-payments/127227/05/15 19:30;;1272.1;answer;;;0;Spencer Hunter (spencer);;"Hey bruschill!  bruschill:Since a verified bank account is needed for scheduled payments, is there a workflow for creating an account if the user's bank isn't found via IVF?I'm assuming you are referring to adding a bank through the OAuth flow? Unfortunately at the present time, the only option for the user to attach a verified bank within that flow is to go through IAV. If they don't have a bank that is supported by IAV, and they are creating a Direct account, then they will need to: a.) abandon the flow and b.) sign up for a full account on .com and add a bank via the micro-deposit method of verification. However, If the user is creating a full account via OAuth then we do provide the option to ""skip"" adding a bank via IAV. This will allow the user to complete the flow and be redirected back to the application without attaching a bank.bruschill:is it possible that Dwolla will support the creation of scheduled payments without a verified bank?When you create a scheduled payment, you are authorizing Dwolla to debit your bank account for the amount and date(s) specified. Although it could be possible to implement functionality to allow users to create a scheduled payment, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. Verifying a bank ensures that there is a ""good"" connection between Dwolla and the users bank. There are situations where users, for example, miskey in their account number.IAV is a step in the right direction towards reducing the time between account creation and transacting with another user, but it doesn't solve for that small banking population that isn't supported by IAV. I will pass along this feedback to our product team, as it will be useful for refining the current UX and enhancing the product as a whole. We are looking at improving our webhooks this year, so maybe a potential solution could be notifying the application when the verification status of a bank has changed?

Actually an easy way for you to implement that would be to allow a Dwolla Direct transaction with a total of 0. In this case you will take the user in the same flow as normal Dwolla direct flow but you will not present the page where there is the different prices and the total. Let's take another example. Let's say the user go through the Dwolla Direct flow and decide to verify the bank account with the two small deposits. How does he verify the amount ? Where does he enter the amount to verify his account ? Does he have to initiate a new transaction though the off-site gateway flow in order to enter those amounts ? That is not really intuitive...

There is no micro deposit verification for dwolla direct. I don't know why I though that there was such verification.

Just send the user off to the URL returned by $auth->genAuthUrl($redirect)Take a look at this guide which explains the OAuth flow.  Essentially:You send the user off to a URL.  Either by redirecting them, providing a link for them to click on, or showing the URL in an iframe or popup.When the user reaches that URL, they are prompted to log in and grant permissions to your applications.  Once they approve (or deny), they are redirected back to your redirect_uri.They will return with an authorization code.

Once the user agrees, Dwolla will send them back to your $redirect_uri along with an authorization code in the URL, so the URL it sends you back to will actually look like this:https://www.myredirect.com/redirect?code=abc1234567890From there, your page (myredirect.com/redirect) needs to actually handle the code parameter in the URL via $_GET, something like this:redirect.php$authorizationCode = $_GET['code'];$OAuth = new Dwolla\$OAuth();$OAuth->settings->client_id = $apiKey;$OAuth->settings->client_secret = $apiSecret;$redirect_uri = ""https://www.myredirect.com/redirect""; // Note: This *must* be the                                                       // same as the $redirect_uri                                                        // used above to generate the                                                       // $authorizationCode, or                                                       // Dwolla will respond with an                                                       // error.$result = $OAuth->get($authorizationCode, $redirect_uri);print_r($result);That should print out your access_token, refresh_token, and some other meta data.

A few questions related to this:--Is there any external way to see if a webhook is working, other than knowing that my endpoint is not being hit?  That would be a nice debugging feature, I would think, for a lot of folks, to just be able to click a button in your app dashboard that triggers an attempted post to a webhook.--The documentation says ""Although Notifications are asynchronous, the information sent with the request will always follow the corresponding information on Dwolla.com and, where exposed, the information available via the Dwolla API. For example, if you subscribe an application to transaction status Notifications, the status value sent via the Notification contains the same status you'd see on Dwolla.com or in a response from Dwolla's transactions API for the given transaction.""  How asynchronous are we talking?  Are there any SLAs at all on when the webhook arrives?--https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/pages/webhooks describes four webhooks, but a fifth one, TransactionCreated, is available in the Add/Remove Application Features page.  Any reason this is undocumented?--Does TransactionStatus fire when a transaction is first created, or only TransactionCreated?  For transactions that involve existing Dwolla balances, and so are processed immediately, do TransactionCreated and TransactionStatus both fire?";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/webhook-debugging-and-documentation-questions/48630/07/14 15:29;solution;486.1;answer;;;1;Gordon Zheng (gordon);;"Hey Eric_Mayefsky,A common cause for failed webhooks is a webhook URL with a port number.  Dwolla will ignore port numbers and default to port 80 for http and 443 for https.  For example, if you set the webhook URL to:http://mywebsite.com:3000/webhookDwolla will actually send webhooks to:http://mywebsite.com:80/webhookLet's answer those questions...I usually set the Webhook ""All URL"" in application settings to a requestb.in when testing webhooks.  This will confirm that webhooks are actually being fired for whatever action you're expecting to trigger the webhook.  It's definitely on our wish-list to build a webhook request/log inspector like Twilio's.There is no service-level agreement which guarantees the timing of webhooks.  We can say for sure, though, that webhooks are always sent immediately after the event which triggers it occurs.  For example, a TransactionStatus webhook will be sent, 1 second after a transaction is created via the Send endpoint, rather than, say, 1 minute.Good catch.  TransactionCreated is a deprecated webhook type.  It is no longer fired, which is why it's no longer documented.  Thanks for pointing this out.  We will remove the field from the Application Features page.When a transaction is created, a TransactionStatus webhook is fired immediately.  Any changes to its status afterwards, say, if it becomes failed or processed or reclaimed, will also trigger another TransactionStatus webhook immediately following the change.Hope that helps!";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/webhook-debugging-and-documentation-questions/486/131/07/14 06:36;;486.2;answer;;;1;Eric Mayefsky (Eric_Mayefsky);;"Thanks gordon!

Is this possible to do?The app is going to be acting as more of a payment facilitator in that a credit card will be issued to the user after they create a Dwolla account. This card would be attached to a business credit account that I own (and I have issued the card to the user for them to use) and would pay the balance off immediately using a Dwolla account that my business owns. So basically, user would enter in their information into my app, create a Dwolla Account, and receive a credit card that would have their name on it and be tied to my business account. When the user would slide the card, the credit card would signal my business' Dwolla account to request/check funds from that user's Dwolla account (After adding in my own fee) using the name on the credit card. If they pass the check, the credit card will be enabled, the merchant will be paid, and I will collect my fee after billing that user's Dwolla account.Now I know people are going to be up in arms about me having merchants still pay a fee, but the key point is that I'm going to charge the customer the same fee. So if a the merchant has to pay an interchange fee of 2.9% because of my card, I'm going to rack that onto what I will bill to my app customer and pay that merchant out the 2.9%. Essentially, the merchant wouldn't pay an interchange fee, the customer would be billed for it and the interchange fee would be returned to the merchant. Am I missing something in this scenario at all?";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/question-about-an-app-forcing-users-to-create-dwolla-accounts/43626/06/14 14:50;;436.1;answer;;;0;Spencer Hunter (spencer);;"Hey npoetsch this definitely sounds like a unique scenario.

The transaction ID that is returned back to us is the transaction ID that the customer will see in their Dwolla account. It would appear that there are two transaction IDs generated, one that the customer paying for something at our store & one that the merchant sees when some purchases something from our store.Customer sees transaction ID of xxxxx94, we receive back transaction ID xxxxx94 from the URL call back which we import and include on our invoice.But when I look at our Dwolla account the transaction ID number is xxxxx93 & there is NO information in the detail section about the transaction orderId or purchaseOrder. The only other place the transaction ID xxxxx93 is transmitted to us is via the email notice that ""Money received"" again there is no detail provided with this email other than amount, name.Seems like if there are TWO transaction IDs, then we should receive both transaction IDs in the form of say:Customer transaction ID: xxxxx94and Merchant transaction ID: xxxxx93The lack of details & not having the correct info available from the Dwolla account seems like a problem when it comes to reconciling our accounting records with Dwolla's accounting records";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/lack-of-detail-wrong-transaction-detail-from-dwollas-accounting-records/17003/04/14 22:46;;170.1;answer;;;0;Gordon Zheng (gordon);;"You're absolutely correct.  Behind the scenes, each payment is actually represented as at least two transactions: a debit from the sender's account, and a credit to the recipient's account.  Each of these transactions has a unique Transaction ID, and this is why the merchant sees a different ID than the customer sees when looking at the same payment.Admittedly, this is confusing.  We're aware of the issue and are brainstorming ways to improve this.  One idea I'm a fan of is abstracting away the idea of a transaction, and instead assigning a single Payment ID which both parties would see (which is what you'd intuitively expect).  In the mean time, however, there's a way for you to map each Sender's transaction ID to the Recipient's transaction ID.  To elaborate, you can call the Transactions / ByIdendpoint to lookup the transaction ID seen by the sender (which is the same transaction ID returned by the Gateway) in order to get the transaction ID which you, the merchant, would see on your statement and in your dashboard.For example, I, Gordon, will send money to Brian and get back the following response, which contains my, the sender's, transaction ID.{  ""Success"": true,  ""Message"": ""Success"",  ""Response"": 4239855}Then, using Brian's OAuth token, I can lookup the sender's transaction ID, 4239855, and get Brian's corresponding transaction ID, which we discover to be 4239854:GET https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/rest/transactions/4239855?oauth_token={oauth_token}{  ""Success"": true,  ""Message"": ""Success"",  ""Response"": {    ""Id"": 4239854, // <- recipient's transaction ID!    ""Amount"": 0.01,    ""Date"": ""12/13/2013 16:00:57"",    ""Type"": ""money_received"",    ""UserType"": ""Dwolla"",    ""DestinationId"": ""812-552-5953"",    ""DestinationName"": ""Brian"",    ""SourceId"": ""812-687-7049"",    ""SourceName"": ""Gordon Zheng"",    ""ClearingDate"": """",    ""Status"": ""processed"",    ""Notes"": """",    ""Fees"": null  }}Now, back to your situation, you can fetch your transaction ID after each successful Gateway payment and store it, so that later you'll be able to reconcile your accounting records.To generate an OAuth token for your merchant account, use our Token Generator.Let me know if I can better clarify any of this!";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/lack-of-detail-wrong-transaction-detail-from-dwollas-accounting-records/170/104/04/14 16:16;;170.2;answer;;;0;CMH (CMH_Electronics);;"I created a Token within my merchant account but when I do a query I get back ""{""Success"":false,""Message"":""Invalid access token."",""Response"":null}"".

The purpose of the app is to help users save their money based on how many times they're spending daily.We've been working on this app and are now in the phase of development and we would like to use Dwolla's API to manage the transactions. We tried to apply for the API key but are a little confused on which category we fall under, personal use or business use. This started as a personal project and eventually showed business potential so we're not sure which to apply for. We planned on prototyping Centraq for the use of our family and close friends though it eventually could launch as a service but for now, we don't have any Employer Identification Number to provide.

Once you've done that, you can create an Application here.  If your concern is how your users will perceive the application -- you'll be able to name your application 'Centraq' so your users will see that they are interacting with the 'Centraq' application, rather than a personal user named Marco.During development, you should set up a few Sandbox accounts which will let you play around without any real money.  There is also an Admin interface which lets you force transactions to fail or succeed, so you can test your app's behavior.";https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/api-request-for-app/260/123/04/14 18:07;;260.2;answer;;;1;Erasmo Marco Esteves (marcostvs);;"Thanks Gordon,I've taken your advice and created under personal account.
