To be able\nto transfer the LSMW file with the converted data to the import program, you\nmust specify a logical file name for the file with the converted data in\naddition to the physical file name. In this case, the system displays\nadditional fields in the 'Specify files' step in which you must enter the\nlogical path and file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe error messages may be due to several causes. Check the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you maintained the logical path and logical file name and have you\nassigned them to the physical file specified in the \"File\" input field of\ntransaction LSMW?\n\n\n\nThese settings are maintained in transaction FILE.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use logical file and path names, you must specify the name of the\nphysical file with its path. If you have not specified any directory, you\ncannot assign any directory to the logical path in transaction FILE. In this\ncase, the system uses the SAP Home directory on the application server by\ndefault. Bear in mind that the file name must not exceed the maximum length of\n45 characters, including the path.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to LSMW version 1.7.2 (*):\n\n\n\nIf the logical file name specified does not point to the physical file\n(although it should do), the system adjusts the logical file name, that is,\nthe information in transaction FILE is changed to the entries made in\ntransaction LSMW. This may lead to unwanted side effects if the logical file\nis also used somewhere else. Therefore, SAP recommend that you always use\nseparate logical paths and file names for transaction LSMW (the problem is\ncorrected as of LSMW version 1.8.0, see below). If the logical file does not\nexist yet, it will be created upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of LSMW version 1.8.0 (*):\n\n\n\nThe settings of the logical file are checked but no longer adjusted\nautomatically as in version 1.7.2 (see above). If there are inconsistencies,\nthe system issues an error message. If the user is authorized to maintain\nlogical paths and file names (as for transaction FILE: \"Maintenance\nauthorization for cross-client tables\"), transaction LSMW can create the\nlogical path, the file name and the file. Due to this automatic generation,\nthe user no longer needs to make adjustments in transaction FILE. Therefore,\nwe especially recommend this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n(*):\n\n\n\nTo display the version of transaction LSMW, select \"Extras\" --&gt; \"Display\nLSMW version\" in the main menu of the initial screen.\n\n\n\nYou should also bear in mind that as of Basis Release 6.20, that is, as of\nLSMW version 4.0, transaction LSMW is no longer an add-on but is delivered\nwith the standard system.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              * \n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n\nRgds,", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:LSMW : Unable to Specify Files .

Save and\nactivate.\n\nThis will create dynamic selections for the fields of the table created in\nstep 1.\n\n\n\nSteps to be followed in the required custom ABAP program to create the dynamic\nselection screen as a subscreen.\n\n\n\nA: Include the LDB program created in step 2, in the attributes of the custom\nABAP program.\n\nNow when you execute the program, you can see the dynamic selection icon for\nthe dummy table created in step 1.\n\n\n\nB: In your custom program we need to suppress the icon for 'Dynamic\nSelections' from the standard selection screen.\n\n We need to perform this action, because the 'Dynamic Selections' icon\nalways triggers a call to the\n\n dynamic selection screen of the included LDB progam. ( In our case a dummy\ntable created in step 1 ).\n\n Whereas we want to trigger a call of the dynamic selection screen of our\ndesired table.\n\n\n\n Logic is as follows:\n\n In 'AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT' event call the FM RS_SET_SELSCREEN_STATUS\nto exclude the fcode 'DYNS'.\n\n\n\nC: Add a pushbutton / checkbox on your selection screen to trigger a call to\nthe FM 'FREE_SELECTIONS_INIT' &amp;\n\n 'FREE_SELECTIONS_DIALOG' in the 'AT SELECTION-SCREEN' event.\n\n\n\nD: When the user clicks the pushbutton / checkbox for dynamic selections call\nthe above 2 FM for the desired table\n\n with the AS_SUBSCREEN flag of FREE_SELECTIONS_DIALOG = 'X'\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Your dynamic selections screen will be created as a subscreen of the\nstandard selection screen and not as a pop-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantage: With the creation of the single custom table &amp; LDB, you are now\nable to create dynamic selections as subscreen\n\nin any program in the system. All we need to do is follow the steps A, B &amp;\nC in each program.\n\n\n\nNote: Your other restrictions with dynamic selection screen ie. submit in\nbackground , save as variant still remain and\n\nyou need to handle them accordingly.\n\n\n\nlet me know if you need sample code.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nBhawit Kumar", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:FM FREE_SELECTIONS_DIALOG", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-08 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "9037.5", "author": "Ebrahim Hatem", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/268874", "text": "Hello **[bhawit kumar](http://scn.sap.com/people/bhawit.kumar) **\n\nI have tried many times without success, I can build a dynamic selection\nscreen but the problem I can not get the values, and if I get them , I get\nthem not correctly, some missing, some not converted like Popup.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn SAP Doc, Dialog for entering dynamic selections as subscreen is not\nimplemented.\n\nany suggest?\n\n\n\nRegards.\n\nIbrahim", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:FM FREE_SELECTIONS_DIALOG", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-08 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "9037.6", "author": "bhawit kumar", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/268874", "text": "Hi Ibrahim,\n\n\n\nI have used the following code to extract the values from the dynamic\nselection screen implemented as the subscreen and convert it into a where\nclause and it works totally fine.\n\n\n\nPlease find below the sample code.

The logic is\nthat the field POPER from FAGLFLEXA is equal to a month of a financial year.\nFor instance POPER = 1 corresponds to April , POPER = 2 corresponds to May,\nPOPER = 3 corresponds to June and so on. The ALV displays the total of the\namount for each month. Example, the month of April shows the total of amount\nfor April given by the field HSL01. The month of May shows the total of amount\nfor May represented by field HSL02, so on. The output is coming perfectly fine\nin my output. But if i am giving any range of POPER in the selection screen ,\nit is displaying totals for all the months.

We print sapscript and smartforms.\n\n\n\nOn one hand we need unicode print and we can have that if we use device type\nSWINCF and SAPSPrint.\n\n\n\non the other hand we have various requirements that requires use of print\ncontrols. For example we need to be able to control what output tray the print\nis delivered in. We kan have this if we send Kyocera Prescribe commands to the\nprinter, but it only works if we use a printer specific device type. It works\nwith Kyocera an HP device types, but we cannot make it work with SWINCF.\n\n\n\nI think the key to solving the issues is to find a solution to pass Kyocera\nPrescribe commands to the printer defined with SWINCF.\n\n\n\nWe have already tried with various combinations of the flags in the print\ncontrol, but so far no result.

The important thing seems to be if the command is near the start of\nthe output request, and I think that this may also be the problem with SWINCF.\n\n\n\nThe history is that we have some old SAPscripts sending a print control for\noutput tray in a non-main window. As you may know SAP script process lines in\nthe main window until the main window of one page is full, then it process all\nthe other windows of that page, before it continues with the main window on\nthe next page.\n\n\n\nWith this scenario a lot of data is printed before the output tray print\ncontrol is fired.\n\n\n\nWe also have some SAP Smartforms build in a similar way, but by Smartforms the\nprocessing is a little different, because the windows are processed in the\nsequence they are defined in the Smartforms editor. We have placed the window\nwith the print control as the first window and so the prescribe or PCL command\nlinked to the print control is placed near the start of the output request.\n\n\n\nWith output device HPLJ4 and Smartforms the output tray selection works on\nboth HP and KYOCERA printers.\n\n\n\nWith output device HPLJ4 and sapscript the output tray selection works only on\nHP printers.\n\n\n\nWith SWINCF the tray selection doesn't work on any HP or KYOCERA printers.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Sending Prescribe print controls via SWINCF", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-08 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "9078.4", "author": "Jnis B", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3759895", "text": "I have happily forgoten most of my SAPScript, so probably this is stupid...\nbut, assuming there is just one Print-Control per form necessary, what about\nFM CONTROL_FORM - would the \"driver programs\" perhaps have enough control over\nopening and starting the forms to issue PRINT-CONTROL via FM call, before\n\"other output\" is processed..?
