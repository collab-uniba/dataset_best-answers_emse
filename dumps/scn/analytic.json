First, when you specify the DATETIME() operator, you are telling IQ that ALL rows for this column will have the same format and be the same width. You then specify the NULL('NA') operator. 'NA' is not the same length as your diatomite format and is thus going to cause offset issues.You need to get your datetime data into a format that IQ can recognize natively. Just putting spaces between the Y, M, and D will do this. If you do this, you won't need the DATETIME() operator and thus the NULL will work properly. You would also remove the FILLER column and just add ',' to the end of the incoming datetime column. The milliseconds has to be separated by a '.' not a colon by default. The FORMAT of your data file looks to have delimiters after each column, except the last. You need to specify that this is a BCP format.Something like this:set temporary option date_order='DMY';load table t1 (c1 ',',c2 NULL('NA') ',',c3 NULL('NA') ',',c4 '\\x0d\\x0a')using client file 'd:\\\\load_datetime.csv'format BCPquotes offescapes off;Your data file would have to look something like this:1,25 MAR 11:12:00.00,NA,23,25 JUL 11:12:00.00,10 DEC 10:00:05:04,4Since you are doing a client side load, you likely have more control over the formatting of the file, so I would recommend changing that process before trying to load.Mark", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:load datatime problem", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Most systems that are sold with SAP products (ILM for Business Suite and NLS for Business Warehouse) seem to be on Linux.We do see quite a bit of AIX, but I would say its a distant third behind Windows. Mostly in sales and systems in production. In terms of system importance, though, Linux and AIX are the two biggest.I don't see much HP-UX in the US, mostly in Asia and it seems to be declining in favor of Linux. Slightly more Solaris in the US, but being an Oracle Operating System now, the market share has certainly declined over the past 5 years.So there you have it, a lot of waffling. In terms of all out performance, scale, and customer installs (that I see), I would go with Linux or AIX.

I hope this is the proper place to ask this question.I am currently undergoing an upgrade to Sybase IQ 16.0. There are two topics of which I am unclear on after reading the documentation.Some background on my installation: Simplex server. Upgrading from IQ 15.2, although I am planning to uninstall that server and all its components and start fresh. I'm not using a SySam license server. SySam will exist on the IQ server ($SYBASE/SYSAM-2_0). I plan to do a GUI installation on Solaris 10.1) When to apply licensesIt seems there are a couple different approaches to this. My understanding is that SySam will be installed with the IQ software package. However, the documentation states I should validate my license before installation. How is that possible before SySam is even installed on my servers. Similarly, if $SYBASE/SYSAM-2_0/licenses is the preferred location for license files, how can they be placed there before SySam is installed?Will I have any problems first installing the IQ software package (including SySam), then place the license files in the license dir and restart the server?2) What variables need to be set before installThe two important variables seem to be $SYBASE and $IQDIR16. Do I need to have these set before I run the installer?Any other variables I should be worried about? Of course, I will be sure to unset all my IQ 15 variables and shutdown all existing IQ 15 services before install.Thank you.", "views": "459", "answers": 2, "author": "Jared Masterson", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ""},

And yes we tried, but the bulk loader doesn't work, and that's needed for performance reasons. (without bulk loader is not an option, it's 10 times slower than SQL Server)But SAP provided a workaround. I had to \"retier\" all the tiered HG indexes to non-tiered. That way it works like IQ 15.x and the bug will not occur.And indeed, until now it didn't.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:IQ 16.0 SP04 PL6 - Fatal crash during BULK load", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Check if they fit machine resources (cpus, ..) and application requirements (LOB, VLDB, ..).This allows you update or fix any licensing issues if any, before 1-month grace period expires.2- Yes, it is possible delay licenses installation after IQ 16 Software installation completed. Install licenses = Download and Put the liceneses into IQ licenses directory.After first starting test (for iqdemo for example), you will see in firt lines in iqmsg file the information related to licenses and errors if licenses are missing or not valid.3- No need to set the variable prior installation. $SYBASE and $IQDIR16 will be added in .csh or .sh environement files by installation process (like in IQ15.2). You need just specify Sybase Home directory when requested during GUI installing.4- You need to prepare and port numbers needed for IQ server and DbaCocqpit are available.Regards,Tayeb.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Questions regarding SAP IQ 16.0 upgrade", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Most datatypes are ANSI standard and apply to all systems. There are certainly a few exceptions to this, but the datatype mapping is not that difficult. Per my note on your other topic of stored procedure copying, I strongly recommend using SAP PowerDesigner.http://www.sap.com/pc/tech/database/software/model-driven-architecture/index.htmlPowerDesigner has the ability to migrate data models from one database type to another. When it comes to datatypes, it does an automatic conversion for you. I would say that about 95% of the work is automated so that you don't have to bother with it. The caveat, the other 5%, are types like NUMBER. a NUMBER in Oracle can represent an integer, float, or double in IQ. So those types need to be done manually. If not, PD converts it to a NUMERIC with no scale and precision which makes for a massive datatype that is overkill.Mark", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:datatypes compatibility list of sybaseIQ 16 vs oracle vs mssql", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

What does \"quickest\" mean to you? Is it the time to just move data? Is it the time to complete the entire project (DDL, data movement)? Is it just as simple as loading the most MBytes/sec?There are two aspects at play here that must be considered.First, you have the data model. You need to copy the data model from one IQ to another. There are many tools available out there to do this. Our recommended approach is to use SAP PowerDesigner for this. It fully understands IQ and all its features so that moving a data model from one IQ to another takes just a few mouse clicks.Second, is the data. This is where things get more complicated because of the number of choices you have.ETL tool -- if you have an ETL tool in-house that you are familiar with, then leverage that tool to move the data for you. Chances are the tool supports IQ.Extraction/load -- As mentioned in other posts, you can use the TEMP_EXTRACT options to have the source IQ extract the data to disk so that you can feed that to the LOAD TABLE statement to load the data on a table by table basis. There are scripts out there to generate the SQL. You could also have PowerDesigner generate these for you.INSERT LOCATION -- if you don't want to extract and load data and take multiple steps to do so, you can greatly simplify the data movement by using the INSERT LOCATION feature of IQ. This will allow the target IQ to reach back to the source system and issue a SELECT statement of your choosing to copy data from the source to target. A single command to do it all. The downside is typically performance as compared to an extract/load. But sometimes simplicity wins out over performance.Other tools/scripts - there are many other tools, scripts, and approaches that customers have taken in the past to do this. They tend to be variations on the above approaches though.Mark", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:IQ 16: Copy tables with 400 million rows?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

However, you mention that the restore of a FULL BACKUP is successful, but RESTORE INCREMENTAL SINCE FULL fails, so we also should look at the validity of the INC Backup, and the syntax being used.=> Could you test re-running the RESTORE but this time specifying all the DBSPACES with the RENAME clause (even the ones whose paths are not changing) ?Was E: created as a network device ? Or is E: a symbolic link to a raw SAN device ?I would also suggest checking connectivity to the underlying disk devices, and the Windows Event log for any issues there (in case there have been any intermittent issues related to the disk subsystem).I hope this helpsKind regards,Andrew", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:During restore, incremental backup - OS Error 40", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

It means that your windows box and IQ server were probably heavily used and at the point when the load was occuring IQ ran out of OS resources thereby leading to the crash. On a reboot all the resources got reset for IQ and it performed the load without any issues. I would suggest when you do run the load, if you can monitor your resources especially on the IQ process that might help you in understanding when this occurs. You might also want to gather stats using iq utilities and monitor your IQ server.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:IQ stop load data with C++ Error", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

:1) We are doing a daily Incremental Backup on Sybase Iq database and the log file that is generating is consuming quite very high space.Though from source we are getting 2 gb data .on an Incremental backup daily its growing upto 90 gb which is not acceptable by the customer.Since we are doing updates and Inserts for the data processing upto some extend if the file gets extended its ok but not upto 90+ gb .As a scenario for data processing we are doing on one of the Transaction table which is Having 1 billion records doing full updates with couple of update statements is this also getting logged ?We want to understand how the sybase Iq Incremental Backup works and the Logging will done.Please suggest us at the earliest .2) When we are querying from Cognos reporting tool we are facing a

Should not truncate be almost instantaneous?3.- An insert update from SAS (72K rows, 10 columns) that use to take 1.5 hrs in 15.2 is now causing the server to stop responding after around 1 hr. It is necessary to kill the server process because even the stop_iq command do not stop the server.4.- Several index look to be corrupted even if the sp_iqcheckdb 'verify database\" return no errors.

Range partitioning was introduced to help customers manage tiered storage as well as overall data lifecycle management.Multiple dbspaces are necessary for lifecycle management. They could all be the same type of storage or less expensive storage for less frequently accessed data. The point being that you want to put your older data onto partitions so that the data and disks can be marked as read only. That way you can back it up once and forget about it until the next time you mark it for read-write to add more data.There is no concept of detaching and reattaching dbspaces. This is very difficult to do. You must remember that partitioning is only done on the FP index. Any other additional indexes are global. This means that the entire HG, HNG, LF, etc index must be placed on a single dbspace and it covers all data in the table. If you were to detach a range partition the data would still exist in the non-FP index structures.We've been asking for local/partition based indexes for some time.

IQ defaults to 1/2 of the first IQ_SYSTEM_MAIN for the IQ_SYSTEM_TEMP size.For both dbspaces, you should consider using more than 1 disk file, but where they are actually allocated (e.g. same device) can make a huge difference in IQ performance, as will CPU and memory allocated/dedicated.I would suggest reviewing the hardware sizing guide available at:http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-41455This will also help determine the proper disk layout and even IQ page size to use (which has nothing to do with row size as with a row-based DBMS).Of particular concern, IMHO, is the use of VM. How many physical (not virtual) cores are you willing to dedicate to the guest? Physical memory? Physical disk devices?Virtualization is good for generally idle desktops and web servers (and development instances where performance is not an issue), but when you get into production DBMS, you must be willing to dedicate proper hardware resources under the VM.There are 2 docs you may want to review on VMware and IQ that might help there::http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-42439http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-58998Chris", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Estimated database size?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},
