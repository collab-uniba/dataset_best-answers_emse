One of the differences between an SAP program (written in ABAP) and a C++ program is that the later becomes independent from its development environment (in the form of an independent, executable file), while an ABAP application needs the SAP runtime system to be executed.\"All ABAP programs reside inside the SAP database. They are not stored in separate external files like Java or C++ programs. In the database all ABAP code exists in two forms: source code, which can be viewed and edited with the ABAP Workbench tools; and generated code, a binary representation somewhat comparable with Java bytecode. ABAP programs execute under the control of the runtime system, which is part of the SAP kernel. The runtime system is responsible for processing ABAP statements, controlling the flow logic of screens and responding to events (such as a user clicking on a screen button); in this respect it can be seen as a Virtual Machine comparable with the Java VM.\" -- Wikipedia/ABAPThat said, let's take a look at your questions:1. I want to develop a SAP Application/addon and i just want to know what i to look for?Please, visit:SAP Developer Center - \"On this site we offer you a complete set of resources for developing with SAP technology, platforms and tools. A one-stop development shop just for you.\"Tutorial: How to install and use the Mini SAP system - this website also has many links to resources on other ABAP programming topics, like Getting Started, ABAP (Basic, Advanced), Development Frameworks, Documentation and Translation, Forms, Basis Components, Communication Interfaces, Business Framework, and Design Guide.2. Is SAPMini enough for the development of an application?It depends on your plans. Like I said, an ABAP program is different from a C++ program. Please, read below:\"What is Mini SAP?The easiest way to answer this question is to explain what Mini SAP is not. Any ECC or ERP business components are missing in this package. But all basis components are available, such as ABAP, ABAP Objects, Smart Forms, ALV, Graphics Framework, all other control frameworks, SAPoffice etc.Mini SAP, which is also known as SAP NetWeaver Trial, or SAP NetWeaver Developer Edition, is free for personal use. Licenses must be renewed every three months.So Mini SAP is the ideal tool both for students to get used to the SAP programming environment as well as ABAP developers to use as a sandbox system. If you want to get a sandbox for the ECC components, you'll have to obtain a license for an IDES system from SAP. This would usually be too expensive for personal use. But you can get free IDES remote access from consolut.\" -- Tutorial: How to install and use the Mini SAP system3.
