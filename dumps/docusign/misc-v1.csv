You could create a custom tag with a Regex Pattern to validate some response, to exclude entries you don't want them use. However, I would not recommend this for validating a  ""date"".  You would need to update every new day you send out,  and there is no guarantee of validation because there are so many combinations and open errors that one could enter for the invalid date.
 
Here is our online documentation on creating  Custom Tags for future reference.
 
You would be better off, updating the original document  with clear instructions, to educate your recipients.

That is possible, but  I suggest using a set of radio buttons. 
It would be much easier to set  one to have the data field appear, and the other  to do nothing if not selected.

Sorry for the confusion, but I can only go in more detail for my first response. 
 
""You could create a custom tag with a Regex Pattern to validate some response, to exclude entries you don't want them use. However, I would not recommend this for validating a  ""date"".  You would need to update every new day you send out,  and there is no guarantee of validation because there are so many combinations and open errors that one could enter for the invalid date.""
 
It is only possible by masking a data field and will not work with a date field. I am not sure if  there is a formula or pattern that you can use for a value greater than todays date.

I am unsure of your question. From what I understand, you are interested in our PowerForm Feature. 
 
*Please Note: PowerForms are only available for DocuSign Enterprise Accounts. 
 
When PowerForms are enabled for your account you can create a PowerForm from an existing DocuSign template. Each Powerform generates a link that automatically creates a DocuSign Envelope, from the Template. You can also embed this Powerfrom link in a Web Page and create custom fields. However, it sounds like your use case will require custom integration. 
 
To learn more about PowerForms, please view our : DocuSign PowerForms User Guide

The Sender specified in the PoweForm will receive a completed envelope notification, when the user submits the envelope generated from the PowerForm. You will have to customize how you update the status of the form on your webpage.

No, but you must be logged in and the admin on your account, must make sure all DocuSign permissions are defined for you as a  Foxit/DocuSign user. If you are not the admin on your account, please contact them for permissions.

We will need to look into your account to determine what options are available. This may or may not be an issue with Foxit.

We learned of the DocuSign Print Driver which seemed to be the solution.  However, this application is not compatible with a citrix environment.  I am looking for any customers who are familiar with LaserPro and use DocuSign.  I am interested in the process others use in getting documents from the system into DocuSign.  If anyone is using a simliar system that would use the same process I would be interested in hearing about that as well. Thanks!;999;1;shaylanking;0;question;Citrix. DocuSign.

You are right. The print driver is not supported on Citrix systems. Please see the Print Driver Quick Start Guide: HERE

However,  a fellow community member might have a workaround.......

We are running in production and demo environments (our production environment is using the DocuSign production environment; our demo envrionment is using the DocuSign demo environment). The interface between my app and DocuSign Connect has been working smoothly for over a year.  Sometime in the last week or so, the demo environment began misbehaving.  In that time, the production environment has continued to work fine. The problem is this: In demo, when a signature event occurs, DocuSign is unable to call our callbackUrl.  The failure log indicates the following: https://[mywebsite]/SignedDocument/DocuSignSignatureEvent :: Error - The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel. When I look at my DocuSign Connect Settings, I see a new setting -- ""Require Mutual TLS"" -- that does not exist in production. I'm not sure if this is related -- I have no idea when this setting was added to the demo environment. Even though this is a demo app, it poses a problem for us (because our demos no longer completely work).  But it poses a much bigger problem if/when this same thing (via a code push or something else) begins happening in production. Again, this interface has been working fine.

I have merged your post with a previously answered thread. Please view the comments above. 
 
No account is required for sign, your customers will just follow the hyperlink in the email that is sent to them when you load documents for them to sign. They have an option at the end to create an account if they wish, and even this will not cost them anything. DocuSign only charges for SENDING contracts. Being a signer is totally free.
 
 
Happy DocuSigning,

Make changes to the case on Day 3 and send another updated quote to the same customer. 3. We have a trigger that deletes the old envelope from Salesforce (the DSX record) upon this event. 4. The customer completes the new envelope and the case is processed all correctly. 5. The old envelope still exists on the DocuSign console (i mistakenly thought emails used the DSX records) and so the customer still gets reminders and warnings related to the invalid outdated quote.

I don't have a solution for you, but have you considered using the ""correct envelope"" feature vs voiding it?

If I am understanding your issue correctly, the recipient is having to sign twice for every tag in the envelope.

I do know that DocuSign converts most form fields from Adobe Acrobat but you cannot assign tags in Adobe or Word. 
Yon can only prepare the API calls offline but you would need to upload/tag the documents in docusign or via the API.

Each parent may or may not sign for the student but at least one must. Some of the parents do not live at the same address as the student or each other, but the address must be prepopulated. However, in the end we would like one consolidated form for each student. I don't care how many envelopes we expend but the prepoplation is important. As far as I can tell, the bulk send feature creates an envelope per line and the envelopes are unrelated by any factor. Or am I missing something crucial? I am willing to use the REST API if necessary but would prefer not to do so.;443;6;kahoover;0;question;;;;;;
08/12/2014 08:07;;32.1;Re: Specifying roles in Bulk;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Specifying-roles-in-Bulk/td-p/37556;"Welcome to the community @kahoover 
 
You are able to pre-populate fields in the bulk recipient file that you upload. 
 
Here is an example:
 

 
Learn more in our guide Building a Bulk Recipient File
 
 
You are right in that separate envelopes in DocuSign are unrelated. 
Depending on your workflow, if the parent's are at differing addresses, they many need to be included in the same envelope. 
 
You may also be able to accomplish with a custom integration. Our Professional Service Team can assist you.

Have you viewed our DocuSign for Salesforce.com Video and Guides 
 
I found the following: 
 
Fields that are text strings must not contain either ',' (comma) or ';' (semicolon), since those two characters are used to parse the string.  Since commas and semicolons could be used in the RecipientNote, you can specify _COMMA_ or _SEMI_ to embed a ',' or ';' in the note. '\\n' can be used to embed a carriage return in the note.  
 
Example: If RecipientNote~RecipientNote__c is:
""Hi_COMMA_\\nThis is a wonderful opportunity_SEMI_ please sign.\\nThank you.""
The note appears as:
Hi,
This is a wonderful opportunity; please sign.
Thank you.

I have responded via email to your request but also wanted to get the answer out here on the communtiy in case this comes up again. 
 
What you are seeing even though you have it set to ""Initial Access"" or ""Each Access"" is intended behavior. 
We have a back end setting called ""Authentication Expiration"" that I am more than happy to set to ""Never"" for you, let me know and I will do it ASAP so you can test. 
 
The easiest way I can break it down for you is to think of it like this:
Authentication on return access means when we CHECK to see if a authentication is needed.
Authentication expiration means when the authentication ends. 
 
Regardless of what you're setting Return Access was, expiration is currently set to ""Always"" meaning their authentication would expire every time they closed the envelope, so when opening it again, we check and they are not authenticated. 
If we set Expiration to Never and return access is set to ""Each Access"" then we will still check for authentication but they will be authenticated so it will skip the process. 
 
Let me know what else we can do to help!";215;N/A;Rickey-DocuSign;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

06/11/2014 22:18;solution;42.1;Automatic Signing;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Sign-a-Document-Automatically/td-p/36920;"Welcome to the community @lahirus 
 
In compliance with esignature principles, we do not offer an automatic signing feature, as it may compromise our security and enforceability of the siging ceremony. 
 
WIth the DocuSign API you can automate many things during the e-signature process, such as populating form/field data, saving drafts for later completion, adding recipients and documents to envelopes, etc.  
 
However the actual *signing* of document(s) is the one part that the human needs to accomplish by actually clicking in the signature tabs.  In fact, it would _not_ be legal if you were able to automate that part as that would circumvent certain security/legal compliances.  So that's the one part of the process that you can not automate, but most other things you should be able to.

26/01/2015 09:58;;45.1;Hello @   Thanks for your post about integrator keys. It'...;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Limitation-for-number-of-Integrator-Keys-to-certify/td-p/38572;"Hello @
 
Thanks for your post about integrator keys. It's always one key per account. When you have time I would review our API certification process located here.
 
Below are the 5 Steps to a Successful Certification:
 

Review the full certification requirementsReview the requirements and prepare all artifacts before completing the PowerForm online.
Complete a Certification Dry RunNOTE: This option is only for customers who've signed up for a Professional Services engagement.  We recommend a certification dry run before the certification process to surface any issues early, while you still have time to address them.  Set up the dry-run meeting at any time through your Account Manager or Professional Services contact, including one at the onset of the project, and complete the dry run no later than two weeks before the actual certification.
Remedy any IssuesRemedy any issues found during certification dry run in step 2 above.
Provide API Call Log Date Range This is part of the Questionnaire in Step 4 above. Provide a date that our Certification Engineers should review to extract your API invocation logs for 20 successfull happy path API calls from our systems to review your API call behaviors.  This date must be within the week of your certification review request
Complete the Certification QuestionnaireProvide response to the questionnaire along with supplemental material described in the following steps.  To receive a copy of the questionnaire in advance of submission, feel free to contact your Account Manager or Professional Services representative. .
Receive CTO Certification Signoff:Once you have completed the form, the Certification Engineer will forward the form and the earlier supporting content to DocuSign's CTO for final approval and sign-off.  The CTO ofice could take an  additional 3 business days to sign off. Assuming no issues are found with the solution's server logs, your solution will be certified within 5 business days from submission of the final items listed in steps 4 to 8 above, after which you'll gain access to the Production environment.  Typically, given the time lapse between certification request submission, review completion that may include revisions and another round of certification review, then your request to submit for CTO review, and CTO review, our customers experience 10 to 14 business days from time of submission to gaining access to production.NOTE: If at anytime after Certification engineer review, there's anything missing, the 6 business day timeline restarts from the time you remedy issues. 
Launch  If necessary, we'll make additional configuration changes to your production settings to accommodate the new integration features.  You'll receive a notification of the completed certification envelope and a separate email for your production account activation.  Your Production account is now ready for use.

Changes are only allowed for recipients who have not yet completed their assigned envelope task. 
 
Has the client you are trying to correct, already signed the docuement?
If so, then you  will not be able to correct, and will need to re-send to the correct email address.

Interesting use case. I do not think this is possible. 
Normally, conditional tags are used to make tags appear instead of disappear....

Unfortunately, you cannot make a checkbox required. 
 
However, I would recommend that you use a radio button, which you can make required. 
 
Please note:
When making a tag required, in a template, there are 2 boxes you need to check in the tag properties. Please see below.

Currently you can only make tags appear with conditional tags. You CANT make them dissappear. 
Additionally, Document Visibility only works at the document level and not the tag level. 
 
However, I think it is a great idea. If you'd like to see this functionality added, I'd recommend that you create an Idea by visiting our Idea Exchange. You can also discuss other ideas, find workarounds and vote for other ideas customers have suggested. You can upvote the ideas by clicking the   in the upper left of an idea.

A future member fills in a form on our web-application (sender) with their personal information and payment information and the chosen membership category. At the end they get an overview (web page) of their membership details and the payment (this is actually the contract). This information is provided by the member and the data is only available during this process. After this point we want to use embedded signing to create a contract with the information of the membership details the member choose earlier in this process (each document is unique). All the contract information is available during this proces. We want the member to sign during the subscription process and not by sending them an e-mail for authentication and signing, neither we want them to login via docusign website. What do you advice to create the contract? First create a document (pdf) of the contract during the subscription process save it and let it sign via DocuSign or create a DocuSign template with the unique membership data transferred via API's and let it sign via DocuSign. What are the possibilities to create the contract? Thanks in advanced.;137;3;marcel;0;question;contract. create.  Embedded. members;;;;;

But what I need to do is redirect the user back to my site once the signing is done. I came accross a support which says i need the branding enabled. I can't really get it.

I've been able to work out with redirect URL. I've still one more thing to do. Say this is my PowerForm url https://na2.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=d3f70eee-f99c-4bb7-bdb9-d557519a26...When you visit the url you'll land on a page where you'll have to fill up name and email. When you hit the Begin Signing  button you'll be redirected to complete the signing. Once you complete the signing you'll land on a specific page of my website.In the meantime I would have a completed singing document in my DocuSign account where I can download the signed document as pdf.But I wonder Signer should get a email  where he can download the signed document from. But Signer doesn't get notified anything on email. Maybe it's because I'm using direct method, Right?  Then how can I allow user to get the PDF of the signed document as it's important that signer should have a copy on his own. Regardsefat;192;N/A;efat;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I have looked at the API walkthrough(7,8,9) , but I want to know how to start off. Some helpful person at another forum pointed me to this http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/embeddedSigning to this walkthrough -  I went through and got some of it.  I have a website and upon registration the users need to be directed to docusign  - Currenlty I already have a document a PDF, which the registered users scan and sign, but I would like  the users to be directed to Docusign  which will host this document, post registration. How do I do that? Should I just upload the document or create a template with the fields from the document? How do I connect to this document on Docusign from my web app?Also after signing I need them to be redirected back to my site.  I see in the api there is returnURl which can accomplish this.When I looked at the embeddedSigning Api I saw we need an Api Key, I tried to generate one from the demo accounts but it prompts for a return URI ..what is this? IS this the return URL? Any pointers or examples on the above would really be helpful . Thanks;170;2;sunnysideup;0;question;;;;;;

I need to be able to programmatically (dynamically) fill in the values for these fields with the values from the CRM. My questions are: 1. Programmatically, is a single POST API call sufficient to achieve this? What fields should I include in the request?2.

However, you can send a document and change the default role of ""Needs to Sign"" to ""Needs to View"".You can make it clear in the subject and body of the message that they must click the ""view document"" button in the message in order to start a 14 day review period, and that the recipient will get another, signable, document 14 days after they first view it. They will go through a similar DocuSign experience, but they will not be given an opportunity to sign. You will then have a record in DocuSign, with time-stamps for when you sent it, and when they viewed it (if they did in fact do so).  Of course, you have to send a separate, signable document yourself after the 14 days are up.  It would be a pretty straightforward use of the API to automate this process, even to the point that the signable version would be sent automatically 14 days after they VIEWED it, not 14 days after you sent it to them, if you prefer. -Peter";84;N/A;petershank;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I'll try to fish around a little and see if I can find more info for how this property works.  In the mean time though, can I ask what your use case is that makes it so you don't want to use Templates?  In general, they can be accessed by your users as shared online documents and you can stop them from making changes, sharing, etc.  You can even control which users can use templates if you want.";998;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I believe I've got some search results that seemed to do the thing I wanted to do. Templates work fine, that's right (and it's possible to supply the data w/o pdfs in some cases), but the initial goal was to process the documents (forms) dynamically without having to maintain more than one source. Templates in this case will requre additional maintenance.

I've been making this mistake the whole time, and I just saw you are doing the same in the examples you provided.
 
The transformPdfFields property is a boolean, not a string.  We have both been setting it to ""true"" which turns it into a string, try just setting it to true.
 
[EDIT]
Here's some sample JSON I used to test this and it worked (i.e. it created Stick-eTabs out of my test document's PDF form fields)  You have to use the compositeTeplates structure as you suspected earlier:
 
{
    ""compositeTemplates"": [
        {
            ""inlineTemplates"": [

Yeah I get what you're saying, the thing is that it's actually a gray area.  Demo accounts aren't exactly customer accounts, they are free developer sandboxes where programmers can start integration testing.  No one has bought anything yet, although if it's possible if you also have a customer account or are using an ""out of the box"" integration that you've paid something.
 
We do have a good amount of automated testing for each build but the rate of new things we add to our platform, such as mobile experiences which are relatively new, has been too quick for the rate at which our automated test plans get updated.
 
In any case, thanks for your feedback, it's always welcome...

Much to my surprise I learned that customFields are not supported for envelopes that are created from templates. If you create an envelope from a document, customFields will show up.  When I tested it in iodocs, I only looked at the From Document scenario figuring that it will work for templates as well - afterall, customFields are envelope attributes.  
 
Big deal and raised hell about it. It looks like we'll fix this with our July release.

If you click on the DocuSign Admin tab then 'Console'then select Preferences (top right)Then ConnectAnd Click Salesforce in the list of Configurations At the bottom you'll see the list of events and the mapping of objects. Looks like you need to add an object to map to your new custom object and tell it what you want to happen when the relevant events are fired.

If you are coding up a C# application you can just reference a template directly in your code.  What you want in that case is to use our 1st API Walkthrough - Send Document Using Template.  The 3rd tab has sample C# code for you to use.

Did you look at the link I provided?  That links to one of our API Walkthroughs which does a signature request.  You should be able to use that code to initiate the request.  And yes it's easy to populate data into the signature request, you just need to add more tabs.

However, I am unable to understand the implementation details. Let me try to explain you. 1. Client creates account in our portal and he clicks submit.2. We will do validation and if validation is successfull we will send the accounts details in the form of XML/CSS3. DocuSing will populate the account opening editable PDFs with the details available in the XML/CSS that was sent by the portal with the signature and send the confirmation details to the portal.

I think the basic answer is yes, you can accomplish this.

3)  Once an envelope expires you can only void it (i.e. can't add anymore signatures).  Here's a previous posting on this:

I still can't seem to get the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms API to work if there are both anchor tabs and PDF form fields. I have included some XML trace snippets below.

However, within the response's <RecipientStatus><TabStatuses><TabStatus> elements, there is no mention of the anchor tabs - only the form fields. It is as if the anchor tabs were never specified. Sure enough, when I login to DS via the web console, the document appears with all the form fields but no anchor tabs. 3) When I send the PDF that doesn't have Form Fields - just anchor text - a CreateAndSendEnvelope request is generated. The XML response is positive and everything occurs as I expect. When I view the document through the DS console, the anchor tabs are there. Is there something I'm missing?

Keep in mind that DocuSign does not support XFA PDF's.
 
This may be more difficult when using a pre existing PDF.
 
The ""Using Anchor Text"" documentation is how you would apply the custom tags to your PDF. You will create anchor text for the custom tag and use the same tag to your PDF and change the text color to white to hide it.
 
When generating an envelope through DocuSign for Salesforce, it will recognize the anchor text and apply the correct custom tag.
 
If you're populating the anchor text into a form field, this may not work as anticipated, because the text would not yet be searchable within the PDF.
 
I would recommend first trying this with a word document to get familiar with setting up hidden anchort text. Then try to tranistion this to your PDF.
 
Good luck!
 
Thank you,
The DocuSign Team";5513;N/A;DerrickT;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

There are 2 issues with this. First, DocuSign parses for text in documents not for the names of Adobe fields.  Second, Conga was configured to flatten PDFs, which was removing the fields along with the field labels. I will work with him to find a solution.  My first thought is to populate the Adobe fields with white anchor text. I will update this thread once we have a solution in place.;5465;N/A;MattPelham;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

We also added ""FlattenPDFForms=1"" within the Conga button so the values are recognized as text by DocuSign. The other cool trick is that you can setup custom tags in DocuSign with specific anchor text and also take advantage of the ability to merge with Salesforce data.  This allows you to take values from specific Salesforce fields to pre-populate DocuSign tag as well as have DocuSign field values write back to Salesforce fields.  In addition to regular data fields you can also create other custom tags that are drop down lists, radio buttons, check boxes, signer attachments, Approve/Decline buttons, etc. A few posts above are links to the DocuSign for Salesforce Merge Field and the Custom Anchor Text guides, which both would be helpful for this.";5057;N/A;MattPelham;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

You can create a custom tag directly from the Custom Tag pallet but many people prefer to create a tag in the DocuSign UI when creating a DocuSign template.  From the tagger when editing a template, create the credit card dropdown tag the way you want it and then choose ""Save As Custom"" from the tag's properties.   Once your custom tag is created, go to Custom Tags, slect the credit card tag you just created and then click the Edit button to open more properties.  Set the anchor text so that it has the {r} variable to allow the string in your document to specify which recipient the tag will be assigned to.  For example \cc_{r}\ set for the tag will assign this to the first recipient if the string in the document is \cc_1\ or for the second recipient if the document string were \cc_2\.

Some client application integrations, especially those installed in other multi-user environments (such as Salesforce, Dynamics, SugarCRM) have the option to store login information for each of the client application users or to designate a single user as the ""authenticating user"", who will authenticate for other users in the account. This allows a client application to store less information about individual DocuSign users and also avoid requesting password information for each user of the client application.A user, known as the authenticating user in this circumstance, that wants to authenticate for other users in the account must have the following DocuSign userSettings enabled:apiAccountWideAccessallowSendOnBehalfOfNote: If you are setting user permissions through the DocuSign web console, these correspond to the Account-Wide Rights and Send On Behalf Of Rights (API) settings.The two methods of for acting as other users are described below:Acting as Other Account UsersNote: This provides functionality that is identical to the ""Send On Behalf Of"" feature.This allows an authenticating user to act as another user in the account. The operations, usually sending an envelope or checking status, are performed as the ""operating user,"" not as the authenticating user. The authenticating user's access_token is used for authentication only, while the ""operating user's"" userId is checked for proper authorization for the API method being called. This allows the client application to avoid storing any tokens for individual users.To act as other account users, the client application specifies the operating user by adding the ""X-DocuSign-Act-As-User"" header to the request. For example:GET https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId} Authorization: bearer <access token for authenticating user>X-DocuSign-Act-As-User: bob.smith@gmail.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/json The syntax email:name is also supported in the <SendOnBehalfOf> node in the ""X-DocuSign-Authentication"" header.";1761;N/A;ebvigmo;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

You need to use our oAuth enpoints to first obtain the proper access tokens, then you put one of those access tokens into the call where you are making a call on behalf of another user in the same account.  You do NOT use the X-DocuSign-Authentication header when making such a request.
 
Here's what I did to get it to work.  In this example User1 will be sending on behalf of User2:
 
1)  Obtain a user access token for User1.  To get this do the following:
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/token
 
(headers)Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
(body)grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={email}&password={password}&scope=api
 
When successful you will receive an access_token in the response body, let's say it is the value ""11111"".
 
2)  Obtain a user access token on behalf of User2
 
POST https://{server}/restapi/{apiVersion}/oauth2/tokenAuthorization: bearer 11111Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {length of body}
 
grant_type=password&client_id={IntegratorKey}&username={$emailOnBehalf}&password={password}&scope=api
 
Note that the email used in the line above, $emailOnBehalf, is the email address of User2 (the user will send on behalf of).  Let's say that the access_token that is returned from this call is ""22222"".

When you have an account in production, it's available features are based off of the plan you purchased (i.e. Personal, Professional, Workgroup, Enterprise), and the website lists the features that are available under each:
http://www.docusign.com/products/editions
 
Having said that, I'm not sure what I can do to ""correct the problem"".  If you want to use some of the features that are not available under Workgroup then I think you'll have to upgrade your production account to Enterprise.  
 
Also as an FYI, members of our sales team would have contacted your hired developer through email after they created the developer account.  If you follow up with whomever sent those emails you can get an Account Manager assigned to your account, who would be able to provide quicker assistance normally...

Nowhere in all of our research before beginning this project or in our testing afterwards, including a query on this forum in December which received a Docusign Team Member response indicating that the API was open and available to all levels of users, was there any hint that that we would be limited or hamstrung in any way. Yes, your sales department insisted on upgrading us from a workgroup to an enterprise account when they were contacted earlier this week, but this seemed like typical sales bait-and-switch mumbo jumbo, which we discounted as totally unreasonable and not supported by anything we had seen in writing anywhere. For a single docusign user like we have here, generating perhaps 10 documents for signing per week at the most, an Enterprise account seems like a ridicules requirement in order to simply achieve proper operation of the API. Again, I have seen no caveats listed anywhere indicating that the API would be dumbed down for Workgroup users, and  I see no relevant features listed in your pricing/feature grid that are not included in the Workgroup account or available as an option or for a fee. I am looking to have those API relevant features enabled and was told to make that request here. Thanks;572;N/A;epicmar;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

However, I'll try to add some clarity here. Firstly, there's a little bit of weird terminology here... mostly in the word ""Enterprise"".  As I hope you know, in order to go live with an integration (either one that is used many times with different clients, or once with a big client), you need to go through a Certification.  The result of that Certification process is that the Integrator Key you used in Demo is ""enabled"" in production.  Without going through Certification, you cannot make API calls (any of them) against our production servers (www.docusign.net, as opposed to demo.docusign.net, etc).  That Certification is not free.  Much like a developer license, etc, we chanrge for that Certification.  Often (though not always) that certification cost is waived with the purchase of an Enterprise support plan, so perhaps there was confusion there? At any rate, assuming you go through Certification (either paid, or as a part of a larger relationship in some way), then your Integrator Key will work against any account.  HOWEVER, not all accounts can do all the things that the API can do.  For example, if you try to send a document through an account that only allows signing (and not originating documents), it will not work.  Or if you try to send an envelope with Anchor tags in it, through an account that doesn't allow custom tags, that feature will not work either. So it depends a lot on the exact features of the API that you are using as to whether you need an enterprise account or not. Have you already gone through Certification?  -Dan";522;N/A;dreid;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Your comments seem sensible. We are back in contact with the sales team and trying to understand our options at this point.  In light of the very small volume that our DocuSign automation will experience and the low value associated with each of the signed documents we will process, a DocuSign Enterprise account or similar pricing structure (just to be able to use the API) would be unworkable. A solution which is significantly more expensive than a Workgroup account would never have made any sense for this project, and all of our research before we began the expense of development indicated that a Workgroup account would work fine. We have not gone through certification yet. It was the beginning of this process that brought to light the unexpectedly high cost for us to bring our little app live. While we had read about the certification process beforehand, and we probably should have assumed that there would be a fee for this, no mention of a cost appeared in anything we read or in any discussion, in fact everything pointed to the DocuSign API being free to use for all paying DocuSign account holders. As for the features available to the API being limited by the features available to a particular DocuSign account type, that too makes complete sense. My problem is that it was never clear in any published sales material or technical documentation to my understanding, which specific API features belonged to any particular DocuSign account level. The two examples our developer gave me which I mentioned earlier did not seem to logically require any particular account type. Even in the example that you have given of ""custom tags"", it is not clear to me where this falls when reviewing the DocuSign  account level comparison chart.  But if I had to guess, I would say it might fall under the ""Advanced Forms & Data"" OPTION for Workgroup users. If this is the case, then we would expect to pay a fee to use this Option ""package"" with our Workgroup account, but certainly would expect it to remain a workgroup account in the way unlimited signature requests and signed documents are available under the Workgroup pricing plan. Well again, thank you for the detailed response. Hopefully there is a solution that can be found for us. We very much appreciate your time and effort. Thanks,Dave";491;N/A;epicmar;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Some background...I've set up a template that has multiple fields, signers, etc.  Envelopes are generated and sent for this template using a custom application that we developed.  This custom app includes a listener for the DocuSign connect service to ping back updates to our application. Some Setup...When we generate a brand-new envelope for the template (including filling out initial values, etc) and send it to the API, all seems to work and the first recipient receives the expected email alerting him/her of the new contract to be signed.  When the first recipient opens the message, he or she is able to see the contract without any problems.  The PDF of the contract is displayed, the initial values are displayed, and the recipient can edit and sign as expected.  At this point, after the first recipient opens the document but before signing it, the DocuSign Connect feature pings our API and passes along the status of the first recipient (Delivered) along with bytes containing the current version of the Contract (in PDF format). The problem...At this point, we expect the PDF data provided by DocuSign to reflect what the user is currently seeing.  However, it simply contains the PDF without any of the initial values.  As soon as the first recipient signs the document, the Connect service pings again and the new PDF at that point is up-to-date with the initial values plus the sender's signature. Possible solutions?There are three possibilities here, and I'm looking for any ideas from either DocuSign or the community regarding which to take:1. This is a bug in DocuSign's feature and they are sending an incomplete PDF on the first update.2. I've misconfigured something somewhere with the template.  I've gone over it a few times and can find nothing.3. This is just something we'll have to deal with.

We do everything from allow partners to integrate to existing customers of DocuSign, to referral deals, to reseller type deals, where we are more of an ""embedded"" type thing. In all cases, we want you to integrate to DocuSign accounts that are ""owned"" by our joint customer.  What I mean by this is that we don't generally want you to make one docusign account, and send a bunch of envelopes on behalf of a bunch of your customers through that one account.  We want to make sure you are linking up to different accounts. Now, sometimes those accounts were for customers DocuSign already had, and sometimes you might bring that customer to us (Referral/Resell, etc). The best plan is to work with our Biz Dev folks. Please send me an email at: Dan.Reid@docusign.com And I'll get you in touch with the right folks to start this conversation! -Dan";201;N/A;dreid;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

If this is checked, this means, the user has agreed on something for $1000.00 and I want it calculated at the bottom using calculated field feature.  So, in a simple diagram, this is what i'm doing: Service Rendered    [x ]    1000.00Total                                  1000.00 The problem is the text input field (that has the parent of the checkbox) has the initial value of 1000.00.  If the user didn't check it, the Total calculated field is still showing as 1000.00 because the formula I'm using is the text_field (which has the initial value of 1000.00).  The question is, how do I make this so that when I unchecked, the total (calculated field) will show 0 instead of 1000.00?;604;3;rahimrahman;0;question;;;;;;

09/05/2013 12:36;true;98;Delay choice of embedded or email signing for individual recipients?;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Delay-choice-of-embedded-or-email-signing-for-individual/td-p/19775;Is it possible to create an envelope, but delay the choice of how each signer will sign (choosing either embedded or via email)?I'm using the REST API.  I keep running into walls trying to implement this.  Can anyone help?Here's our desired workflow:All signers are known upfront.1. Our website has an entry page requesting the first signer to begin the process.2. The first signer is always embedded.  The first signer signs the document.3. The signing result is captured and we move to an envelope status page.  From this page we can independently choose when and how the subsequent signers sign.  For each signer we can choose 'sign via email' or 'sign now' (embedded).3a. If a 'sign now' option is chosen for any of the listed signers, they're taken through the embedded process.  The signing result is captured and we move back to the envelope status page.3b. If a 'sign via email' option is chosen, the signer is sent an normal DocuSign signing email.   We remain on the envelope status page and we can still independently sign the other signers.Ideally, we'd like to send the envelope request with all signers included, but retain control over when they're emailed or presented with an embedded sign page.  That doesn't seem possible with the current API as you can't switch a signer from email to embedded and vice-versa.I've been able to put together a work-around solution by only including the first signer with the envelope request and dynamically adding the remaining signers later.  I use a dummy signer to keep the envelope open until all signers have been added.  This almost works, but I lose my tabs with the later signers.  I seem to be stuck in an edit-mode, where the signers need to place their own signatures and initial-here tabs.Is there another way to go about this?  Any help would be appreciated.

I think you're actually already onto the correct way to go about this.  The dummy signer algorithm is what first came to my mind after reading your desired workflow, and I believe that should work here.  
 
I think you're losing your tabs because when you modify or add recipients of an in-process envelope the tabs are dropped (by design) and need to be added back in.  Have you tried adding the tabs in by specifying them in the body of your request to add or modify recipients?";327;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

In fact, we even have some current integrations doing this...
 
What you could do is *always* make it an embedded signing experience, but if they click the ""Sign via Email"" button you generate a custom email and send to them for them to access the envelope.  And then in your DocuSign account settings you could turn off email notifications so that they only get your email.  Make sense?

Sending emails this way with the 4.0.2 release will result in Subject and Body being null.  I am now passing the Subject, Body and Language to from the DocuSignAccountConfiguration object to each the recipients created by the Docusign_Envelope_Recipient.  Since you can set each recipient's Language, the Body and Subject now lives on the Docusign_Envelope_Recipient. For anyone else that uses their own custom Controller or Service Class to generate recipients, this should help out. Thanks,;969;N/A;michaelokeefe;3;answer;N/A;;;;;

I want one other person lets say Z to be notified whenever A,B,C,D and E receives an e-mail for reviewing and Signing the document from DocuSign. Also, Person Z should receive Completion/Declined e-mail as well Note that Person Z need to have read only access and he/she is not going to sign the document that's why I am adding him as Carbon copy recipient. However, to achieve the above requirement i.e.. Notifying Z overtime a signer recipient receives an e-mail for reviewing the document, I added same person Z with recipient id as 6,7,8,9 and 10 (as recipient id needs to be unique) and routing order as 1,2,3,4 and 5. Also, I need to keep the different  name for the person Z otherwise DocuSign API throws an Exception saying that ""Envelope has Duplicate Recipient"". I have two concerns over this approach:1. Name needs to be different for carbon copy recipient in above scenario, so in practical situation this is limiting me in a sense that, for the above scenario if I want to add the same person in CC but this seems to be problematic as I need to pass different name each time I add the same person. And this changed name appears in Carbon copy e-mail. 2. Even if I add different names just for testing it further, I found that when envelope is complete, and if there are N mo. Of signers , Person Z in above scenario receives N completion e-mail. In above scenario person Z receives 5 completion e-mails. Whereas expectation is to receive only 1 completion e-mail. So query is:Can I add the same person as Carbon Copy Recipient multiple times to receive notification at each stage of envelope routing as well as to receive the completion e-mail only once. FYI - I even tried setting Person Z adding only once with routing order as ""1"" as well as routing order ""no. Of Signers +1 "" in these cases  Person Z received e-mail at the beginning of flow and at the end of flow only and did receive only one completion e-mail however, requirement of notification to person Z at each stage could not be met.

The reason I ask is because there are differences between API accounts (which are created through demo.docusign.net) and non-API accounts (created through www.docusign.net).  Accounts created through www.docusign.net cannot make API calls as they do not have Integrator Keys.  They do, however, have some options that are not available for the demo API accounts.  I think the Branding->Resources page is one of them, along with the html option you are referring to.
 
If you're using a www account you'll need to follow up with support or your account manager, as these developer forums are for API specific issues and I have no control over those accounts.  Let us know when you get a chance...

I then send a new envelope with RecipientId = ""1"" and Name = ""smith john"" and Recipient View Request with ClientUserId = ""1"" and UserName = ""smith john"". The response I got back was that DocuSign was unable to identify the recipient. It seems that once I send an Id paired with a Name, DocuSign stores that info and expects these same id + name pairs to be used for all envelopes. In addition it seems the id must be an integer between 1 and 127? Since we have thousands of user id's in our system, this would imply that we pre-assign a DocuSign id# to just the users who will be signers.

When you refer to the Recipient View Request we call that ""Embedding"" functionality.  There are three different flavors of Embedding:  there's Embedded Sending, Embedded Signing, and Embedded DocuSign.  All of these use cases initiate requests by generating a user authenticated URL that has a TTL (time to life) of 5 minutes.  (In other words they expire after 5 mins.)  The benefit of Embedding is that you can navigate your users direclty into a workflow without having to wait for an email to arrive and click on the link.  With Embedding (aka Recipient or Sender View Requests) you can seamlessly integrate DocuSign functionality into your app or website.
 
When you create an envelope if you add a recipient and set their recipientId, name, and email, then this recipient is known as a Remote recipient.  They can only access the envelope through email notifcations.  However, if you add a recipient to the envelope that has the recipientId, name, email, AND clientUserId, then they are known as a embedded recipient (captive recipient if you're using SOAP).  Embedded recipients can only access the envelope through URL tokens.  
 
The trick is remembering how your recipients have been configured.  As you have found out, the system identifies recipients by the combination of name, email, recipientId, and clientUserId (if present).  If you create a recipient and specify the name, email, recipientId, and clientUserId, but then later on in the same envelope you try to reference that recipient by only matching the name, email, and recipientId, an error will be thrown.  Likewise, if you create a recipient with the name, email, and recipientId defined, but then later on you refer to that same combination and also include a clientUserId in the request, the system will once again throw an error.
 
As for your question regarding the actual values, there are no such limitations that I'm aware of.  Both the recipientId and the clientUserId properties are strings, so you should be able to place whatever you like in there.  I think the only limitation is that it has a capacity of 100 characters.
 
Hope this helps...

If the xsd is not listed on that page for REST I'm not sure we have it listed somewhere, however when I compare to the SOAP specs it does indeed show the recipientId as a positive integer and the clientUserId as a string.  And I don't see why those two properties would be different in REST.

When creating an envelope, if you specifiy the following recipient info for example:

email:  john@email.com
recipientId:  1
clientUserId:  1
 
Then the only way for this recipient to open the envelope will be to specify all 4 of these exact values again when requesting the recipient view.  If you specify the same name, email, recipientId, but give it a different clientUserId then you will get that error.  Same for anyone of the other 3 properties.  
 
Therefore, when you mention that if you use any other info other than your dev account info you get the error, my question to you is if in this instance you are creating an envelope in the first place with that ""other"" info?  In other words, if you are requesting a recipient view for the above recipient except that the name is ""Sally Doe"" instead of ""John Doe"", when you were creating the envelope that you are testing with did you provide ""Sally Doe"" for the recipient name?";2030;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

That's what I was looking for. I think it would greatly help to publish the full xsd for the envelop definition request on your reference page: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/help/operations/PostAccountsAccountIdEnvelopes. I was going by the xml created from the C# sample application I download from the dev center. This source code send a recipient id of 1 for the envlelope, then a clientuserid as 1 for the view request and it worked so I based my calls on that. I did not realize that envelope definition had a signer clientuserid field sa a parameter. I did just now find a JSON sample for a signer under the envelope definition in the REST reference, but that does not show on the first page of the reference for this api call. Again, DocuSign should provide at a minimum the full spec in both JSON and XML (as XSD) for each request and response call. I think that would greatly help the developers. A lot of the pages at the help link above have xsd's for request and response. Not sure why the envelope would be left off seeing as that is the primary data object for the entire system.

On first glance, I'm wondering if this is a casing issue.  I noticed that you have capital letters for the signer objects in the request that's generating the error:
 
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<Recipients xmlns=""http://www.docusign.com/restapi"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"">

         <email>bogusemail@gmail.com</email>
         <name>Kenny W</name>
      </Signer>
   </Signers>
</Recipients>
 
As a test can you please try with lower case Signer tags and let me know if that works?  I know that we don't have the best error logging when it comes to xml or json that the system can't handle, it's quite possible that is causing your issue.  (You'll notice that your other requests that are successfull have lower case <signer> tags...)

Let's say you have an envelope with 3 different recipients, and for each recipient you have a signature tab and a date signed tab.  As you've noticed, the date signed tab auto-populates with the correct date based on when the recipient is signing the document.  
 
In this example if the first recipient signs the document on April 1, then the date signed for that recipient will have 4/1/2013 as its value.  Then let's say the second recipient signs the document on April 2, the date signed tab that was added for them will have the value 4/2/2013.  And finally the third recipient signs on April 3, the 3rd date signed field will have the value (4/3/2013).  
So following this logic you should already have the date the third (or last) recipient has signed the envelope.  So I'm confused what you're asking...

In additon to the 3 signers, with a ""Sign Here"" and a ""Date Signed"" tab for each of them, I want to have ANOTHER tab, somewhere else on the document, that auto-populates with the date when the LAST recipient signs the document. Once all recipients have signed, that becomes the effective date.  The closest I've come is to have an anchor tab such as ""\lastSigned\"" defined as a ""Date Signed"" tab, bnut only for the Nth recipient -- the 3rd if I've generated the contract for 3 signers, the 2nd if I've generated it for 2 signers, and the 1st (and only) if I've generated it for 1 signer. Then, as long as the recipients sign IN ORDER (1 then 2 then 3) (or at least, as long as the highest-numbered recipient is the last to sign), it will work, because by the time that recipient signs, the others will have signed, and the field will properly auto-fill when the last one has signed.

The way our system works is that you each and every tab is assigned to a recipient (or a template role if you're using templates).

I'll try to think of a solution to this but you might have to download the documents once they are completed (signed) and use a document editing tool to add that 4th date.  One other thing I was thinking about is envelope Custom Fields (which are different than custom tabs).

When making your API calls you can set the ""routingOrder"" property of your recipients.  If you have 1, 2, 3 then the second recipient can not sign until the first has finished, and the third can not sign until the second has finished.  Additionally, if you give two recipients the same routing order and then they can sign simulatenously.  So if wanted you could have something like routingOrder = 1 for the first two recipients, and routingOrder = 2 for the last recipient, and that would also make it so that the last recipient can't sign until the first two have, but the first two don't need to wait for each other.
 
And to answer your second question, yes this is also possible to add calculated date fields.  Basically you would add a custom tab of type Formula and format Date.  The following guide shows how to use the datediff() function to make your caculations:

Remote recipients initiate requests and sign documents by accessing hyperlinks in emails that are sent to them.  Embedded recipients, on the other hand, do everything by accessing user authenticated URLs.  (They might still get email notifications when things happen, but any actions are started through URLs.)  These two types of recipients can not be mixed- once you create an embedded recipient that recipient will only be able to access the envelope through URLs, and remote recipients can only access a given envelope through email.  
 
The clientUserId property is required for Embedded users.  Basically if you have it defined for a given recipient then that recipient becomes an embedded recipient.  If the clientUseId property is not present, then the recipient is a remote recipient.  
 
Having said all that, I'm a little confused on your use case, can you please explain your issue a little more?  For instance, you've started by saying that you can't use Embedded Signing because the auto generated emails would be lost for some reason.  Did you mean to say you can't use Remote Signing here?  Please explain more in-depth and we'll see if there's a solution we can propose for your needs...

We were initially looking at the Embedded solution. The Big issue though was that we would lose the system generated emails from Docusign. The option that we had was to create our own emails which was just too big a cost.So we decided to use the Remote solution instead, which would give us all the emails. These would be used as calls to action for our customers. We will have a lot of documents going out so we needed all the mails. In our Customer website, we have created a set of screens showing all related envelopes and their status(based on tables we have created internally). For completed envelopes we can allow the customer to click and view the documents.The issue we have is that we want the user to be able to click on In process envelopes also to trigger the Signing ceremony. So we just want to mimic the email link for the envelope, so that the user can either click the link in the mail or if they happen to be in our portal website they can click on the envelope needing to be signed.So we are looking to generate the email link. We have all the envelope related information in our tables. How can we pull in this url or create it in some way to allow this action? Thanks;249;N/A;deccorry;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Basically it seems like you are asking for some kind of hybrid between embedded recipients and remote recipients, and I'm not sure if that's possible.  Hopefully someone else can chime in on that if it's inaccurate.
 
In our system there are two types of recipients- 1) remote and 2) embedded (aka captive) recipients.  As you've found out, when using remote recipients all the calls to action are done through email notifications, and links within those emails.  For embedded recipients you don't have to wait for emails- you can generate URL tokens that can be used to immeidately start sending or signing workflows.  
 
A recipient is deemed remote or embedded at the time the recipient is first added to the envelope.  If they are added with captive info (clientUserId) then they are an embedded recipient, and you will be able to generate a URL (or the email link that you are asking for) for this recipient to start a signing or sending workflow.  However if they are a remote recipient (i.e. they do not have any captive info such as clientUserId defined) then you can not generate a URL for them.  (You'd get an error saying unkown recipient if you try to generate a URL for a remote recipient).  Instead, in this case you would have to use the system genarated emails for your calls to action for this recipient.  
 
This is all by design, so I'm not sure how to get around that unfortunately  :|";220;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I know that we have plans to improve our documentation in this area as it's not very clear at the moment, but let me ask you what you are using the clientUserId property for?  
In our system there are two main methods of initiating signature requests and signing documents.  The first method is referred to as the ""Remote"" method, while the second is referred to as ""Embedding"".  With Remote recipients everything is initiated through email links, which of course means you have to wait for emails to arrive before you can do anything.  With Embedded (aka Captive) recipients, instead of email links you can initiate sending or signing sessions by generating URLs (that expire) that your recipients use to directly access a given envelope.  
 
When recipients are first added to an envelope, they are either a remote recipient or an embedded recipient- and that is determined by either setting the clientUserId property or not including it.  If the clientUserId property is present and not null, then that recipient is embedded.  If it's not present, they are a remote recipient.  
 
Keeping that in mind, another thing that's important to mention is how DocuSign identifies users (or recipients in this case).  A recipient is defined by 4 things -- email, name, recipientId, and clientUserId.  All of these must be the same for the system to match a given recipient.  If you have two recipients with the same email, name, and recipientId, however they have a different clientUserId, then these are treated as 2 unique recipients.  And I have a feeling it is this aspect that you are running into.  If you have a DocuSign account your signature image is stored in your account and can be used again in the future, and if you are saying that this image is coming up for your (supposedly different) recipient, then I'm guessing that the system is identifying them as you.
 
Can you confirm any of this?";284;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I understand that you need email, name, receipientId, and clientUserId when identifying a user to retreive a URL back for that user.  Thanks-Jameson";273;N/A;jameson_allen;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Please review as there's lots of good stuff there.
 
To answer your question in short, if you open a completed PDF document in Adobe Reader and click the Signature Panel button you can view a wealth of information about the signature and if it's valid or not.  
 
Next, if you have an envelopeId and the completed PDF document(s), you can click on an actual signature tag and it will start you off on a screen that asks for the envelopeId.  Once you enter the envelopeId, if it's a valid document you will be able to view it through our system.
 
Lastly, in every completed envelope there is a Certificate document that is generated and added to the envelope.  You can download this separately or download it as part of a combined document for all the docs in the envelope.  The certificate has the envelopeId and hashes of the documents, and it also has tamper proof technology which makes it apparent (by adding a red X) if it's been tampered with.

You happen to join right in the middle of a very rare bug we have with the Integrator Key screen at the moment.

In the mean time though, to help you get a head start I want to make sure you're aware of some of our most valuable tools for developers.  
 
The API Explorer allows you to make any and every API call, without writing a single line of code.  
 
And our API Walkthroughs show 9 of the most common API use cases, each written in 5 sample languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python).  Feel free to copy the language of your choice, plug in your credentials (minus the integrator key for the moment), and once the key issue is resolve you'll be ready to roll!  
 
The REST API Guide has lots of valuable information as well, and here's a link to the SOAP guide in case you want to use that protocol.  
 
Hope this helps...

Docusign doesn't mandate a specific wire sniffer tool.  However, we do point to Fiddler if the customer makes a request.  I've attached instructions on Fiddler to grab the appropriate content.  I've also attached examples for the final output for either SOAP or REST.
 
For the second question, we require the full request.  The trace must be a raw, fully consumable request and response including headers. DocuSign should be able to recreate the event using the provided trace. We are looking for the verb/method, URI, endpoint, authentication method, credentials, and payload. The intent is to validate that your Support teams can provide this information when contacting DocuSign Support for backend assistance.

In our system you can add new signers (whether they are embedded or remote signers) as long as the envelope is not complete yet.

Let's start with two possible workflows one of your envelopes might take.  You've mentioned in your last post that an envelope might have one document and one signer and once they are done signing, after checking some external criteria, the envelope is complete.  In this scenario, what is the routing order of the dummy signer, when were they added to the envelope, and what do you do with them after the one and only signer has signed?
 
Then let's look at the other end of the spectrum- let's say you have 3 recipients you want to have sign the envelope.  Do these 3 signers have unique routing orders, and what routing order are you giving the dummy signer?  And after the first signer signs, do you modify any routing orders?";672;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

The routing order is determined by our internal workflow configurations. This is the scenario that needs to process. All other scenarios are basically a subset of this one. Step 1Initial envelope contains one or more documents and one or more signers. These initial signers can sign in any order. When all signers have signed it goes to step 2. I'm only adding the dummy signer here to keep the envelope open for subsequent signers to be added. If there is another way to keep the envelope open/stop it from closing or reopen it let please let me know. Step 2Optionally adds N more signers. All these must now sign before going to step 3. These N signers can sign in any order Step 3Optionally adds M more signers. All these must now sign before going to step 4.These M signers can sign in any order. Step 4.....and so on until some criteria is met and the system decides there are no more signers. At this point we need to download the final certified copy containing all the signatures.

The routing order is determined by our internal workflow configurations.
 
I don't understand this part, and I'm wondering if this is what's causing your issue.  Every recipient that is added to an envelope has a routingOrder that is supplied by your client app.  If you do not specify a routingOrder, then it defaults to 1.  So all of your recipients (as well as the dummy recipient) will have a routingOrder = 1.  When recipients have the same routingOrder and it's their turn in the order, they are each allowed to sign at the point and don't have to wait for anyone else, is this your intended behavior?  
 
And what routingOrders are returned when you do the Get Recipient Statuses call on your envelope?  Are they all 1?  
This is the Get Recipient Status call";636;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

1.  Create an Envelope with N signers + one dummy signer.  Give each N signer a routingOrder of 1, and the dummy signer a routing order of 2.  Since the normal recipients have same routingOrder they can all sign at the same time.  
 
2.  Once all signers have signed, if no more signers then delete the dummy signer and the envelope is complete.  If not complete, add M signers with routingOrder = 2, add one new dummy signer with routingOrder = 3, and delete previous dummy signer (routingOrder = 2).
 
3.  Repeat step 2.
 
I believe this algorithm will accomplish what you are looking for.  Let me know if it works...

For your first question I know that there's an account setting called ""Envelope Stamping"" that can be used to remove the envelopeId that is placed at the top of the documents.  Please contact your account manager to get this option enabled.
 
Second question- I'm actually not sure if it's possible to completely turn off all email notifications (it might be) so I'll have to check on that.  Which email notifications are still coming through to you even after you've unchecked all of them?  On what actions?
 
Third question- I will also have to check and see if there is anyway to disable signing except for through embedded workflows.  
 
For your last question unfortunately there is no way to limit the options on that drop down.  When you are in that mode it is referred to as ""Free Form Signing"" (i.e. when there are no pre-placed signature tabs) and that list always has those options.";231;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

All tabs except for list boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes have a property called concealValueOnDocument which has the following description from the API Guide:
 



concealValueOnDocument
No
Boolean

Optional element. If true the field appears normally while the recipient is adding or modifying the information in the field, but the data is not visible (the characters are hidden by asterisks) to any other signer or the sender.
When an envelope is completed the information is available to the sender through the Form Data link in the DocuSign Console.
This setting applies only to text boxes and does not affect list boxes, radio buttons, or check boxes.




 
It states the value is only visible to the recipient and that the signer and sender can't see it, is that what you're looking for?

System sends an e-mail to an individual (only one signer in a workflow) using DocuSign template.2. User fills in some data on DocuSign Template, this information is sensitive e.g. Bank Details, SSN etc.3. Once the signing is complete, Signer will receive an e-mail with Document attached where he/she is able to view data he/she has entered in Document Review Stage of DocuSign. 4. we have a system in place where we could read the data from DocuSign 'completed' envelope and save it in DB/File etc.5. Now this user enetered data, can be viewed on DocuSign web console through Sender's account. To do this, Select envelope ->Actions -> Form Data , it does display table with control label with their respective value. This we want to avoid. So If I am not making it more complex, Its acceptable and desirable for us that user entered data is visible to the person who has entered it and it could be read by our system but it should not be visible to any other person not even to sender. So Requirement # 1 is:1. Turn off Data visibility for Sender on web console for certain/all workflows. 2. Turn off Attachment to completion e-mail/Turn off completion e-mail for certain workflows but not for all workflows. Thanks,Shriniwas;416;N/A;shriniwasm;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I don't think this is possible.  In all the potential solutions I've been exploring it seems there's no way to hide the data from the sender.  Even with concealed values on the document they can make an api call to get the actual data so I don't think that will work.  I'm waiting to hear back from one other person but so far I don't think this is possible in our system.  You can hide the data from other recipients but not the sender of the envelope.

We have no restriction on when these happen, They could happen one minute apart. Does downloading count as a status check and is it subject to the 15 minute restriction?
No, it is not subject to the same restrictions and you can download the documents as much as you want whenever you want, as long as you don't exceed 1000 calls per hour per account
 
(3) What is the size limit on a single file to be signed? Is there a total size limit per envelope? Is there a total file count limit per envelope?
For performance we recommend individual files do not exceed 25MB, but we do not impose a limit on file size, number of files per envelope, or total size of an envelope.   They are all unlimited
 
(4) Are there limits on total documents processed per account per time period?
No, no limit.
 
(5) Are there any other usage limits we need to be aware of?
No technical limitations, but be cognizant of the account plan you purchase and how many envelopes are allowed, features available, etc.
 
(6) Specifically what options are available for accounts that need > 1000 api calls per hour and what are the associated costs if any?
We do have options if you need to make more than 1000 api calls per hour, those would be discussed as part of your contract with DocuSign.  You'll have to contact your Account Manager for more information.";651;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

That did clarify a lot. I looked over some of the API calls related to account/billing and have some follow up questions: (1) The workgroup plan for example allows 2-10 users. Would each signer be considered a user? How are the users uniquely identified / tracked / counted on the docusign system (i.e. by name or by name + client id) ? What happens if an API call refers to say an eleventh user and the plan only allows 10...will the call return an error? (2) The professional plan indicates 50 ""Request Signatures"" but unlimited signed documents. Can you please explain the difference? How do I get data from the API on how many Request Signatures have been used and how many total are allow for an account?

We're considering using DocuSign with Salesforce.com Enterprise Edition.  I scanned through the User Guide and Admin Guide for DocuSign for SFDC, but wasn't clear on these questions.  I'm trying to understand the ability to automate our order process after the document has been sent.  Specifically: 1. Is it possible to track the status of the document/envelope on a Lead, Contact, Account, and/or Opportunity record.  From what I saw in the DocuSign user guide, the only way to see the status of envelopes is in a DocuSign custom object in SFDC or in DocuSign itself.  In other words, it didn't seem possible to see the DocuSign envelope attached to a Contact, Account or Opportunity and with a status.  Or if it is possible, then it would require a custom Apex trigger in Salesforce.com to do this.  What is the most common way for tracking whether a document has been signed by a particular Contact on an Opportunity? 2. Once the document is signed, is there any way to get that signed document automatically in Salesforce.com and attached to the Contact, Account, and/or Opportunity?  Again, my initial read is that there are no standard mechanisms for doing that.  Correct? 3. After a document is signed, is there a way to automatically trigger an email alert to go to our Finance and Legal teams with a link to the signed document? Thanks in advance for any advice.;396;1;dlee388;0;question;;;;;;

Thank you for contacting our community support for assistance.  In response to your questions above, it is possible to track the status of a DocuSign envelope in Salesforce.  Once it is signed you can also have it attach to a record in DocuSign as well.
 
Please use this link and reference page 14. http://www.docusign.com/sites/default/files/DocuSign_for_Salesforce_Administrator_Guide.pdf
 
For the third question, this would require custom work and could be discussed with your Account Manager.  If you do not have an Account Manager, please contact our sales department for conversations on how to upgrade your account.

On one hand I simply confirmed the behavior that you saw.  However, there is also the ability to optionally specify the file type.  This, based on the wording of error messages, should negate the need to parse the file name for a file extension.  From everything I am finding, the issue is not that you have a period in the filename but rather that the filename does not contain a recognized file extension (such as .doc, .pdf, etc.).  In the example provided the extension would be parsed as ""Test_io1212_247 Managed Service - Default Adv_05-03-2013-090504"".
 
To conclude, you should be okay to either include a file extension in the filename (as in: 001_New_.Test_io1212_247 Managed Service - Default Adv_05-03-2013-090504.pdf) or to include a fileExtension element in your SOAP or REST API calls.  In the REST API this is specified in the Content-Disposition header (as in: Content-Disposition: file; filename=""test1.pdf""; documentid=1; fileExtension=""pdf"") whereas the SOAP uses a FileExtension element within the Document element.
 
Ergin, would you please confirm this behavior?  I'd like to ensure this is accurate information.

Through my testing I've found that the ""file_extension"" parameter in the Content-Disposition header doesn't seem to matter, looks like the only thing it considers for the type is the Content-Type header.  If set to application/pdf then I was able to send PDFs that had several periods in the name and did not have a .pdf extension on the actual file.  (Of course, if they did have the extenstion that worked too)  If someone wants to send a different file format then you simply need to set the Content-Type header accordingly (i.e. application/text, application/msword, etc.)  When I changed or set the file_extension param on the Content-Disposition header it didn't seem to make a difference...

So kind of an interesting situation here.  I have a feeling the system is acting as designed here but would like to flesh this out a little more to see if a potential bug exists.  Stick-eTabs are always added with respect to a recipient (or a template role in this case) so when you add one for the first role and make it required, it is indeed required for that role.  And when you add the second data field for the second role and make it required for them it does indeed become required for the second recipient.  
 
I guess the confusion comes when you add the ""Allow All to Edit"" option in.  This option allows recipients to collaborate/share a tab by allowing them to modify the value even though the tab was added for a different recipient.  From my testing so far it seems that the Required option is working correctly (since that is with respect to the recipients they were added for), and it seems that Allow All to Edit is also working correctly, however as you have stated when these options are combined it's possible that one of the data tabs be left empty at the end of the transaction.
 
I'm assuming that the end result you want is that both data fields in this example be editable by all recipients, however you also want them to not be empty by the end of the transaction, correct?  If so, I'll have to circle back on my side and see if this is possible, either through these options or through some other mechanism.  But in terms of making them required I think the system is working correctly, since the first tab is required for the recipient it was added for, and likewise for the second tab.

When combined, the expectation / hope is that these fields would be editable as well as required for all (both) roles.

Since tabs are added with respect to recipients, and at the time of each recipients' signing their respective data fields are required for them, the Required option is functioning properly.  And the Allow All to Edit functionality is also working, since they are allowed to edit each other's data fields. 
 
The questions start to arise when we consider both options together.  In a way, it's undefined how these two options should function together, since as mentioned tabs are only required for their respective recipients.

You can use email to initiate requests, where the View Documents link opens the signing experience for your recipients, or you can use Embedding which is a neat feature.  With Embedding you don't use emails at all, instead you can initiate signature requests by using URL tokens.

In some cases, these same examples have used config files to store the username, password, and integrator key. Perhps it depends on the implementation & workflow but, is there any reason I would not want to make a single call, say using curl from the command line, to grab the base URL and account ID once and then store the returned values off in a config file? In other words, why would it be necessary to make a call every time to get this information? It seems like it would not change except based on the enviornment you're in (live vs. demo) which would be the type of thing we would store in a config file in our implementation.

It's all based on how much security you want on your side- storing in a config file as plain text has a risk of someone getting a hold of that file and seeing your passwords and such in plain text.  On the other end of the spectrum you could encrypt your passwords, keys, etc while on disk and have a program decrypt them and pass them into our api, all up to you / your company.  
 
In terms of the actual baseUrl and accountId values, I don't think your accountId would ever change and you're mostly right about the baseUrl in that it's mostly a switch between demo and production environments (ie demo.docusign.net and www.docusign.net); however I'd note that it's possible the api version could change in the future.  Right now it's version 2 so the baseUrl is similar to -- https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/ -- but of course if a newer version of the api came out it wouldn't break any existing integrations so you'd be ok on that front...";467;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

They are a way of holding some higher level info about your envelopes and transactions and I think you can have as many as you want.
 
For the RSA fail question, I believe this can be accomplished through the SOAP API but perhaps not REST yet.  Check out the SOAP API documentation (online or PDF) and do a search for ""AuthenticationStatus""

The data fields will show the default values you sent when you begin the signing workflow but without you completing your actions (i.e. signing the document in this case) those data fields have not actually been set yet.  This is why after you sign the document but before the second signer signs if you then download or print it will show whatever values they had when you signed.  And once the second signer signs then if you download or print it will show their data as well in the final document.

Immediately they can go to Print/Download and see all the Data Fields populated in the Print Preview and on the Document if they download.

Or at least ask the signer if they want to save it first then print. We have instances where a signer might want to fill in the form, print it for offline review, and then come back in and print.  Currently they would need to click Finish Later, come back into the form, then print for the template data to show in the printed copy. Another illustration of why I think this is a bug is it works differently depending on the document you start with. For example I created a 'test' case document using MS Word. I loaded that into the DS admin console to create a template by just dropping some text fields on the page. (Docusign converts the Word doc to a PDF on load.) If I bring this template up into an embedded console and type some values into one of the text fields and click the Print button, those values WILL print.  If I try the same thing with a document that started as a PDF and that I templated by letting DS convert the PDF fields to tabs the values will NOT print during the sign process until you click complete.;522;N/A;tameyer;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I've found that you can accomplish this through the ""Envelope Report"" located in the DS Console.  Try logging into your dev account then go to Preferences and under the Account Administration section on the left you'll see the Envelope Report link.  Inside there you'll see your envelopes list, and a check box all the way to the right.  If you click that box then hit the ""Publish XML"" button it will re-publish, even if the status was not a fail.  Please let us know if that resolves your issue...

If the 'Order' is set up like this, then you are sending the unsigned document to both the signer and the carbon copy at the same time.  This would allow the CC to view the blank document since the signer has not yet viewed or completed the document.  If this is how you had the routing order set up, try this way below making the CC #2 in the order.
 
Order:              Email:                  Name:                Action:
1                test@test.com           TEST                    Sign
2                test2@test.com         TEST2                 Carbon Copy

To do this you please login to the Console and in the top right select Preferences.  On the following page on the left select ""Manage Email Notifications"" under the Member Profile section.  Near the bottom you'll see a checkbox labeled ""An envelope that I have sent has been viewed.""  UN-check that option to stop those emails.
 
As for your main question, I'm a little confused as to what your scenario is.  I see you mention that your document can be filled out and signed at anytime and can be signed multiple times, however I'm still not sure what the use case is.  Do you have a setup number of recipients?  How are you defining the routing order for each recipient?  Note that if two people have the same routing order then they don't need to wait for each other, but if the routing order is 1, 2 then the second person can't complete the document until the first one signs, etc.";535;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Let me see if I can explain our scenario a little better. We have a request form that our clients can fill out and submit to us at anytime via mail, drop off, or fax. This request is initiated by our client. We have a web portal that our clients can log into. Only our clients are able to register and gain access to this portal. I setup a template for testing purposes and was able to embed the template into a page on our portal using the DocuSign API. Each instance of the request form is only signed ONCE by one signer (the client who is logged into the portal). Once signed, we get a copy of the form--this part works great. The only issue is if a client navigates to the page with the embedded request form template, decides against filling it out and navigates away from the page (clicking back, closing the tab/window, etc), we are left with a pending sign request in our account. I assume this is because an envelope is created for the embedded sign request. Is there anyway I can have this envelope only appear if the client actually SIGNS the document? Or, is there some event I can listen to (via DocuSign connect?) that I can use to delete the envelope if they navigate from the page? I am creating my envelope with CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates and getting the embedded token with RequestRecipientToken.;531;N/A;ksmith173;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I think you can accomplish this a couple of ways.  You can check the envelope status and if it is ""Delivered"" then that means that the recipient has viewed the envelope but not signed yet:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/Status%20and%20Managing%20Group/EnvelopeStatus.htm
 
I think you can also use DocuSign Connect as well... you would just set it up to push the ""Envelope Delivered"" event when that occurs and you can then delete the envelope or void it or do whatever you'd like at that point...

I haven't dealt with this area too much in the past so I put your question in front of some co-workers, this was the response:
 
This I believe is dependent on the plan.  We have two pricing options: per seat or per envelope.  Depending on how they pay additional seats or additional envelopes are subject to charge according to their plan.  I would consult the plan description that these guys are referring to or just connect them to sales.
 
What I gather from this is that depending on what type of plan your users have the pricing will either based on number of users or number of envelopes per month, and is subject to additional charges if you go over whatever limits are in place.
 
As mentioned, if you would like more info or still have questions I can connect you with someone in sales who could explain more...

Sorry but this functionality is not currently supported in our system.  Once signature requests are sent the document cannot be changed.  If there are corrections to be made to the document they need to be made outside of our system then send a new request with the new document(s).  In your users' case, they'll probably have to Void or Decline to Sign then have the requestor send a new envelope...

Ok, so from DocuSign end, this is not possible and once a document has been uploaded for the purpose of signing then apart from making it void or declining to sign, there is not other option cirrently in DocuSign. To achieve this, we need to handle it outside DocuSign. Regards,JoWo;401;N/A;jowo1900;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Currently what we can do is from the envelope ID we can use it to download the required document and open it in an external PDF viewer, for example, Adobe Reader or Foxit Reader.

Thank you for using the DocuSign Community Forum.
 
DocuSign has an add on option called 'Powerforms', and what Powerforms do is allow you to add a link on your website that will take you directly to a DocuSign document.  Powerforms will ask your signer for a name and email address, but will not require an email be sent before they are able to access the document.  This is a very handy feature if you have a registration form, or application you would like people to be able to access without needing to send a document via email.
 
Powerforms are an add on feature, and if this is something you are interested in, 
Please Contact Us for more information. 
*You can reference this community post so you don't have to re-explain the issue.
 
Below is a user guide that explains Powerforms in more detail.

IODOCS
 
With the API Explorer you can plug in your information and actually create and send sample requests right there through the site, and at the top right of the page if you click the API Walkthroughs then you'll see we have 9 walkthroughs that show you common programming tasks with our API.  The last three all deal with Embedding- embdedded sending, embedded signing, and embedded DocuSign (i.e. start in the main console). Check them out here:
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthroughs
 
Aside from that, I know that we're currently having issues with the demo server right now which is causing some errors to be thrown, so it's possible the errors you're getting are due to a problem on our side.  Please hold off for a few hours and try again as we're hoping to have them resolved by then.  
 
Hope this helps...

Demo accounts are free accounts that make calls against our demo server (demo.docusign.net) instead of the production server (www.docusign.net).  When you are creating your app or website you first create a demo account, generate your integrator key through the Preferences -> API page, start testing your API calls, and once you're ready to go live into production you go through our Certification process (similar to getting an app approved on the app store).
 
In terms of the API functionality, yes if you do not want to use emails for your signature requests then you can use the Embedding method, which uses authenticated URL tokens to initiate requests.  Have you seen our API Walkthroughs, located here? 
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthroughs
 
The last 3 walkthroughs (7, 8, 9) show you how to use Embedding functionality in 5 different languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python).  Copy the PHP code into a local php file, change the integrator key, email, and password at the top, and run!  The result of each of those 3 walkthroughs is a URL that you're website can then navigate to, making a seamless transition for your users.  
 
And with our API Explorer you can make test API calls without writing a single line of code.  This is a good place to start and you can even create your JSON bodies using this tool then insert into your code and modify if needed:
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com
 
Last but not least, the online REST API Guide has additional info that can help guide your efforts.
 
Hope this helps...

Connect configuration is on an account basis, so connect messages would be sent to the listener(s) configured for the account.  It is independent of the sender  operating as themselves or sending on behalf of others. Note that you can't send on behalf of a user in another account, but only on behalf of another user in the same account.
 
It is possible to use envelope level connect configurations to direct the connect message to another URL (per-envelope, instead of per-account).
 
So it looks like Connect will still push events to your listener for envelopes that are sent using the SOBO (send-on-behalf-of) feature.

(If the API is not enabled, then DocuSign cannot access document information via the SF API. IssueWhen picking Send with Docusign, the user sees a message indicating that a DocuSign object does not exist (for example: dsfs__DocuSign_Status__c does not exist )Possible Resolutions:The user is not part of the Profile that has permissions turned on for DocuSign objects. Change the user's profile to point to the profile with DocuSign object privileges set for read/write/edit/delete.The current profile doesn't have all DocuSign objects set with read/write/edit/delete privileges. Review the profile and turn on read/write/edit/delete for all DocuSign objects. IssueDuring the ""Send with DocuSign"" workflow, the partner portal user sees errors that a field does not exist, or the user observes that there are fields missing on the Page. For example, the document name, the recipient name or the search box used to search for a recipient.Possible Resolutions:The field-level security for DocuSign object fields is not set to visible.  Edit the Partner User DS Profile (substitute the name of the profile you created) and find the Field-Level Security section.

So when you're in development you always hit the URL  https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/login_information.  This call, as you've seen already, returns the accountId and baseUrl.  This baseUrl is used for future API calls and will start with demo.docusign.net/...
 
Once you get Certified you will then be able to make calls against the production server login resource, which is   https://www.docusign.net/restapi/v2/login_information, and that will then return a baseUrl for the production system (i.e. https://www.docusign.net/...) which can be used for your production API calls.
 
Does that answer your question?

So far I don't see anything in the documentation that demonstrates how or if it's possible to retrieve the actual template role names through the API.  I'll have to look into that.  
 
Is your question more from an automation standpoint, or do you just need to get that information?  I know you can manually download the template then parse the data looking for the role names.  If you log into the member Console then go into the Manage area then Templates folder, for each template that is listed you can download the XML, then parse the data looking for the roles.";466;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

02/03/2011 08:13;false;202;DocuSign API Rate Limits & Security Requirements;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/DocuSign-API-Rate-Limits-amp-Security-Requirements/td-p/2509;"DocuSign usage has grown exponentially over the last several years. In fact, more than 5.2 million customers trust DocuSign with their signature, having signed more than 50 million documents to date. We know we wouldn't be celebrating our success without the Developer Community and your work to integrate solutions with DocuSign's electronic document and signature management platform. THANK YOU!

To ensure our customers continue to trust DocuSign for the fastest, easiest, most secure way to get a signature, it's important that we put further safeguards in place to protect our multi-tenant data centers. While you have probably already heard through our webinars and certification sessions that additional security was in the works, we are taking these proactive steps now as our Developer Community continues to rapidly expand. 

Effective immediately, the following requirements will be implemented to ensure that DocuSign remains the fastest, easiest, most secure way to get a signature:

Usage of Integrator's Keys
DocuSign introduced Integrator's Keys nearly a year ago to identify third party applications. While we have made it a requirement that every integrated solution uses the Integrator's Key, we have relied on self-compliance with this policy. Going forward, the use of Integrator's Keys will be mandatory.

Effective March 15, Integrator's Keys will be mandatory in developer sandboxes (demo.docusign.net)
Effective May 1, Integrator's Keys will be mandatory for all API calls on production (www.docusign.net)

If you don't have an Integrator's Key, follow the below instructions to acquire one today:
1. Go to your demo account at https://demo.docusign.net
2. Go to Preferences > API
3. Create a new key
4. Make the one line change in your code described here: http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/DocuSignService%20API%20Overview/Integrators%20Key.htm or here: http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/DocuSignService%20API%20Overview/Authentication.htm
5. Complete the certification form to get the process of migrating the key to production started: https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=eba33282-061e-4d20-aad4-a4a829cbdd...
Please note that web service calls without an Integrator's Key after March 15 will receive an exception on every call made.

API Call Rate Limit
To maintain reliability and stability within our demo and production environments, DocuSign has operated with certain API call efficiency guidelines. To ensure effective load balance, we continually monitor the API calls in our backend systems and reach out to work with developers putting unnecessary burden on the system. Going forward, DocuSign will implement an API Call Rate Limit to further balance loads on the system.

Effective March 15, the demo environment (demo.docusign.net) will be limited to a call rate of 1,000 API calls per hour per account
Effective May 1, the production environment (www.docusign.net) will be limited to a call rate of 1,000 API calls per hour per account


Please note that when the API call rate limit is reached you will receive an exception on every call for up to 60 minutes, until the next hour starts.

There are a number of ways to minimize API impact such as using bulk operators for requesting status, utilizing DocuSign's event notification feature, and refraining from repeatedly requesting information on envelopes that are in terminal state (Completed, Declined and Voided). If you find that your application still requires more than 1,000 calls per hour per account, please contact service@docusign.com for help in re-architecting your solution.

Applications that have gone through DocuSign certification within the past year and complied with all efficiency and security guidelines should not be effected. To test your application under these new requirements, run it against demo.docusign.net after March 15 to ensure no interruption of service within production.

Again, thank you for your support of DocuSign to date and going forward with the use of Integrator's Keys and working within API call rates to further ensure the security and stability the DocuSign developer environment. If you have any questions, please start with our Developer Forum: http://community.docusign.com. Thank you!

Let me clear a few things up first - are you a software developer?  If not - then you don't need to worry about this.
 
If you are a software developer and you have got yourself a developer sandbox through http://www.docusign.com/devcenter you will need to log into the sandbox environment.
 
To get there use this URL: https://demo.docusign.net/ 
 
You can use a password recovery option there.  You can also probably see what the password is in your code and just use that to log in.

However, in the Connect Service documentation suggests also setting up a nightly batch to request statuses for those cases when the connect service fails, since when the service fails it doesn't retry.  But we understand there is now a request acknowledgement feature on the Connect Service.  We are hoping this will eliminate the need for a nightly batch job (which is complicated by the once-every-fifteen minute limit), but have been unable to find any documentation about it or how it works.  Do you now if it will eliminate the need for using a batch job on top of the Connect Service?  Do you know where we might find out how to use it? Thanks.

I'd like to qualify the answer you've got.  The types of call that we ask people to limit using are calls for getting status and documents out of our system.  What we found out is that a lot of people just set up an endless loop of getting status for envelopes that have no chance of changing their state.
 
We have plenty of people make calls to create envelopes way more frequently than every 15 minutes.  It's absolutely fine to do that.
 
With the introduction of acknoledgement of the events you no longer have to set up a nightly batch job.  The nightly batch job was a best practice to ensure that none of the events were dropped.  Now you can call an API to get the list of events that have not been delivered.

If so, is it considered best practice to do housekeeping tasks like calling GetConnectFailure as part of the connect service (i.e., what if no one does anything for a period of days)?  Or is there some way to get the connect service to re-try if there are failures? -- Assuming that we do have to set up a nightly batch process to avoid relying on user actions, we need it to update everything the Connect Service would otherwise update.  I understand that RequestStatuses will allow us to get the envelope statuses, but not the document bytes or the recipient statuses.  To get fully updated information on an envelope, we need to make two status requests for each envelope: GetEnvelopeStatus to get the details including recipient status, and GetPDFDocuments to get the bytes of the PDFs contained in the envelope. If we are only allowed one request-type call every 15 minutes, does that mean we should force our nightly batch process to sleep for 15 minutes between each of these requests?   That seems kind of strange, but it also seems like the implication of the way the API is designed, unless we can get the Connect Service to retry automatically.  Is this right? Thanks again for your help. Gordon;5048;N/A;gordonmgreen;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Connect Events are published in response to an event happening.  In case you are in normal event flow you are going to see events when users take action.  However it's not that the users browser is doing anything.  We have an event queue internally that queues up the events and then dispatches them to the appropriate parties.
 
There is a way to retry the failed events.  Please see: PublishConnectFailures API.  It's pretty simple to use.
 
In regards to the 15 minute limit.  There are things that you can do to not be subject to the limit.  The limit is for repetitive calls that retrieve essentially the same information.  However if you had to retrieve 1,000 envelopes we would not make you spread out the calls over 11 days.  You can request those with a lesser timeout between calls.  What we don't want you to do is we don't want you to request information on the same envelope 1,000 times and we also don't want you to do it all at once.  If you need just-in-time information Connect events is the right design pattern.
 
I have posted the design on retries as a separate thread.";5046;N/A;mikebz;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

So, it sounds like what we can do is structure our ConnectService handler, very roughly, like this: -- Read in connect XML from DocuSign.-- Update all the status information and document bytes in our system from the connect XML.-- If successful, return an acknowledgement back to the service-- Use GetConnectFailures to get a list of current failed envelopes.-- Retry our processing on those envelopes.-- Post any that failed back to DocuSign using PublishConnectFailures Which means we don't need a nightly batch job at all, and don't need to make any Request-type calls.  Alternatively, we could put the last three into a batch job. I have been a little confused by the DocuSign Connect Guide, which  doesn't seem to mention these aspects of the process.  Let me know if there are any videos, documentation, etc. that I am missing! Thanks again.;5047;N/A;gordonmgreen;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Our workflow is that the documents are created on our document server with form fields for sign here tabs, full name tabs and date tabs. I am then using iTextSharp to retrieve the co-ordinates of the fields and I'm then adding them to the tabs collection using the .NET client library. This is working perfectly for the X positioning, unfortunately it isn't working so well for the Y positioning as the tabs do not lign up consitently. To obtain the Y co-ordinate I have tried the following: pageSize.Top - fieldPosition.position.Top - fieldPosition.position.HeightpageSize.Top - fieldPosition.position.Bottom - fieldPosition.position.HeightpageSize.Top - fieldPosition.position.ToppageSize.Top - fieldPosition.position.Bottom where pageSize is the value iTextShart returns from GetPageSize with the appropriate page supplied.Does somebody know what I'm doing wrong here? I noticed that the API provides an AnchorTab feature, however as far as I can see this can only be used to anchor the tabs to a string pattern and not (unfortunately) to a form field which to my mind is the most obvious thing that tabs would be anchored too. I don't think our legal department will agree to having invisible text in our documents so the string matching will probably not be an option.;286;6;markritchie;0;question;;;;;;

This will directly convert the PDF form fields into DocuSign form fields.  You can do this manually when you upload a PDF to create a template or you can include the PDF in your API call and do it dynamically.  In either case the position, field size, and various other properties are inherited from the PDF field.
 
Does that seem viable for your case?

As I mentioned the PDFs are generated dynamically on demand so its not an option to manually upload the PDF. It needs to be when I send the PDF to DocuSign.

I must either extend Apache's library to add an extra CRLF, or manually construct the HTTP requests with an extra CRLF. Interestingly, HTTPClient can access the /login_information resource with no problems, so I'm not sure where exactly in DocuSign's API this behavior manifests. I dug into Apache's HTTPClient/Core source, and determined that it's not worth it (right now) to try to modify them to accomodate DocuSign's API. My current needs are simple, and I can deal with having to maually assemble each type of HTTP request. For larger applications, I imagine this would be a significant headache. To explicitly state my solution and findings: 1. Apache's HTTPComponents' HTTPClient and HTTPCore cannot upload documents to DocuSign's API. That library places one too few CRLFs between the end of the request headers, and the boundary that marks the start of the JSON that is the input to the DocuSign API.  2. Following the instructions on this StackOverflow page will allow you to send documents into DocuSign's API,provided that you make the following changes:  // Send binary file.
writer.append(""--"" + boundary).append(CRLF);
writer.append(""Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\""binaryFile\""; filename=\"""" + binaryFile.getName() + ""\"""").append(CRLF); needs the documentId added to the Content-Disposition line: // Send binary file.
writer.append(""--"" + boundary).append(CRLF);
writer.append(""Content-Disposition: form-data; documentId="" + document_id + ""; name=\""binaryFile\""; filename=\"""" + binaryFile.getName() + ""\"""").append(CRLF); and the first thing written to the PrintWriter needs to be an extra CRLF: writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, charset), true); // true = autoFlush, important! becomeswriter = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, charset), true); // true = autoFlush, important!
writer.append( CRLF );Commenting out the extra CRLF allows me to toggle my code between ""generating the error in the subject line of this thread"" and ""successfully sending a document out for signature.""";3176;N/A;AWBFG;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

You can implement powerforms very easily, and not have to deal with inherent powerform limitations, for example....the maximum length of the full request url.
 
Powerforms pass data through query string parameters, and there isn't an alternate way of passing in data.

In our system you can send signature request either through email links, or you can use ""Embedding"" which means you do not send the request through email but instead you provide a URL that the signer can navigate to and start the signing process.  And they do NOT need an account to sign through the URL.  You NEVER need an account to SIGN, either through email or through URLs.
 
So yes, with Embedded Signing I think you can accomplish what you've been asking, which is that the person SIGNING does NOT need their own account.
 
Have you seen our IODocs website?  It has a very useful feature called the API Exlporer.  With that, you can test out Embedded Signing by plugging in your information into the page and then getting the URL back, then you can give that URL to someone else and have them sign the documents.  Have a look here...
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/
 
Then click the RequestSignature tab, then the very last POST is called ""Creates recipients for a draft envelope"".  Try it out for yourself...
 
Also on the top right of that page is our API Walkthroughs, and more specifically you should have a look at this one:

If needed we can always do a call with DocuSign Support and Conga Support on the phone as well.  If needed email service@docusign.com to set up the meeting with Conga.

Thank you for using the DocuSign Community Forum.
 
Once you have completed signing your document, you will have the option to review the document.  Once you are in this screen that is showing the signed document, if you look above the document itself, you should see 'more options' and 'close'.  Just to the right of these two options is a printer icon, and a tab that says 'PDF'.  Select the PDF tab to download the document, and save it to your desktop.
 
This is something that can also be accessed by going in to your 'Manage' tab in DocuSign, and selecting the document by double clicking your mouse in the document.  This will take you to the same page that will allow you to download the document.

The way our system works is that any and every document that is sent through our service will automatically be stored in the cloud.  You can retrieve it at any time in the future by requesting the documents in a given envelope (or just request a single document), and then copy it to a local database/file vault/somewhere else locally.  So the basic point here is that you don't need to store your signed documents locally if you don't want to, since they are stored in the cloud without you having to do anything and you can retrieve them in the future.

If you do not plan on using DocuSign on a daily or weekly basis, you would probably benefit from our DocuSign Professional plan.  This plan offers 50 envelopes (documents sent) per month, as well as unlimited signing.
 
If you have more than one person that will need an account, you will want to look in to one of our Workgroup plans.

I just tested it out and I get the same error you do, and I believe this is by design.  I get ""an error occured during anchor tag processing"" when I try to create a draft envelope and save it with the custom (anchored) tab but with no documents in the envelope.  Even if you set ""IgnoreIfNotPresent"" on the anchor tab to True you still get the error and to me this makes sense, since it doesn't have any documents to check against.  I will try to confirm that this is by design and not a bug, which I don't think it is. 
 
Let me ask you what your use case is, and why you need to add the tabs in before you add the document(s) to the envelope?  Do you not have the documents at the time of envelope creation?
 
Also, I'm wondering if using templates might help you here.  With templates you can save whatever tabs you'd like to go into the document(s), then you can create an envelope without any documents in it and then when you finally add the documents apply your template.

I have attached two screenshots herewith. Role_1.jpg and Role_2.jpg. It contains part of the text from document which gets disrupted as the document goes to the two signers. The formatting of the dynamic fields has been configured only once in Docusign template, but still, the placing of the data changes for both signers. With regards to this, I was asking you if I can configure the top and left positions in some other units. Could you help me resolve this dirupted text issue? Is it possible in DocuSign? Thanks.--Ketkee;462;N/A;ketkeea;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I would probably have to see how your tabs and recipients are setup to be able to resolve as I don't have enough information right now.  You can try changing the units (i.e. mms, cms, pixels) but I doubt that would resolve if we don't understand what's going on first.";451;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Is it possible to configure a recipient specific e-mail sent through DocuSign either through web configuation or API. Like for   User 1 contents of e-mail would be different from that of User 2 in same workflow. Also, is it possible to add recipient's e-mail address being added in cc of workflow  'completion'e-mail (Completed/Declined). This recipient is not taking part in signing process and not even wish to 'receive a copy' during the workflow. User is only interested once workflow is over and wish to receive an e-mail with his/her address in cc field of e-mail. Thanks,Shriniwas;555;5;shriniwasm;0;question;;;;;;

This 3rd party is not going to sign/view the document. It is merely interested in receiving an e-mail at the end of the workflow It's more of a situation where 3rd party would initiate a manual action/system trigger once he/she receives completion e-mail. Further to this, Preferably is it possible to add this non signer's e-mail id in ""CC""  of  completion e-mail which gets sent from DocuSign at the end of the workflow in case of a completed state or Declined state.

It does not solve my problem, but we have suggested a work around for the problem.I have done this setting via the DocuSign UI. Would like to know the API to set a note to recipient in the e-mail. I find that the Note field is present in the Signer class of DocuSign.If I use that I would need to use the DocumentSignatureRequest instead of TemplateSignatureRequest that we are currently using to finally call the DocuSign API.

To answer your question about Carbon Copy CC recipients, since they are only allowed to view the documents they will not see custom data assigned to their recipientId.  HOWEVER, once the documents are completed (signed) then if they view the documents again they will then see the custom field data.  Go ahead and test it out, I just confirmed myself through a quick test.

Now i have ""Allow recipients to edit the document"" at template level. One question. When i select ""Allow recipients to edit the document"" option at template level, doesn't it get set to all the data field tags?  I did selected ""Allow recipients to edit the document"" at template level. Refer below screen shot. By doing this setting, when ""Role 2"" opens envelop for his signature before ""Role 1"" does, then for ""Role 2"" no data displayed in any field.  However, when i set ""Allow all to edit"" for individual data field tag properties (refer below screen shot), ""Role 2"" user can see data in fields, even if he opens the envelop for his signature before ""Role 1"" opens the envelop.  I thought ""Allow recipients to edit the document"" at template level sets ""Allow all to edit"" for all data field tags available in the template. Do they really have different functionalities? If no, then how can template level settings be applied to all the data field tags? Because setting this property at individual data tag, resolves my issue.

The ""Allow recipients to edit documents"" option allows users to add markup (i.e. sig tabs, data fields, etc.) to the envelope.  The ""Allow all to edit"" checkbox on a particular tab allows all recipients to edit that data, instead of just the one recipient who it was added for.  
 
I think what you'll need to do is create a template, add your tabs, set AllowToEdit to true for the tabs that you want multiple recipients to be able edit, and apply that template(s) to future envelopes.";560;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Each document is a pdf and has very similar structure and layouts. (i suppose they can even be 100% identitcal as per my requirment.) Now even though i have these multiple documents, only the first Document requires a Signature, and there will be no tabs on the other Documents.

The idea is to use the following workflow: 1- DocuSign user will open a template and sign2 - Customer (in person next to Docusign user) will sign the document using tablet3 - Document is sent to both emails  The main point in here is that the customer does not need to open any email or validation code to sign the document. is it possible or do we ALWAYS need to sign using the validantion code?;302;1;Bruno_Giusti;0;question;;;;;;

However, DocuSign does offer a feature called In Person Signing. You designate the name and email address of the host (in your case the DocuSign user) and the name of the signer (Customer). The host must have a login to a DocuSign account (you should be good since your host is the DocuSign user). The host will receive an email telling them they are hosting the signer. They are instructed to give the keyboard to the signer (Customer). The Customer signs and then gives the keyboard back to the host who is then required to login to DocuSign to verify their hosting the signer. So you could build a DocuSign teemplate that has your user sign first, then host the Customer signer. Learn more about In Person Signing:Classic DocuSign: Sending for In Person SigningNew DocuSign Experience: In Person Signing Regarding the validation code, are you talking about DocuSign authentication of the signer's identity? DocuSign does not require signers to enter any validation code (Access Code) unless the sender of the document explicitly specifies an Access Code is required for a particular recipient of the document to verify the correct person is signing.

06/07/2015 09:24;false;246;Anchor tags and the API;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Anchor-tags-and-the-API/td-p/42560;"I have created a template for one of the contracts the City uses frequently.  The template has anchor tags on it because the length of the contract can change and I need the tags to stay in the right place on the signature page. The tags work fine when I ""manually"" send a contract to a vendor for signature.  The tags move based on the length of the contract. However when I use the Laserfiche interface which uses the Docusign API, the tags become misaligned.  Attached are examples of both instances.  Does the API have the same functionality as the ""regular"" user interface?  Is there a solution to this issue.

This functionality works in the DocuSign for Salesforce integration because it was explicitly coded to do that. Your API code needs at define tags assigned to your recipients and specify the appropriate anchor text as a way of positioning the tags where those anchors are found in your document. There is a SOAP API Code Walkthrough for Anchor Tabs available. Two additional notes:You have not left enough room for the Signature tag before your Date field. DocuSign cannot dynamically modify your document content to make room for the tags.You will want to change the color of the anchor text \s1\ etc. to white text so it does not actually appear visually in your document. DocuSign will still recognize the text is there but it will not be visible on your document. Otherwise this text is going to exist in your final document and obscure the DocuSign tags.Regards,Michael;272;N/A;mlevy;2;answer;N/A;;;;;

If you are looking to custom code with API integration, it is very possible to have a 2nd document triggered upon completion of your first document. I have not tested it, however you may be able to add the same user in the 2nd order of the routing with a different role.  Maybe have the first role as Customer Signature and the 2nd role as Customer Attachment.  The document would not show completed, however you would be able to have documents added after signature. Not sure if this is what you are looking for or not, but hope it helps. ThanksAdam;221;N/A;SmithAdamL;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

For security and enforceability issues, you cannot edit a completed document. 
 
The signer attachment tag is always required, but there is a workaround to make it optional. 
You can make the Signer Attachment tab conditionaly dependent on a yes/no radio button. If the signer selects yes, then the signer attachement tag will appear. 
 
The Yes/No radio button will drive a conditional field (the 'child' field being the signer attachment tag)  .. once the condition is met, the signer attachment tag appears.
 
Setting up is similar to making other tabs conditional, just applied to the signer attachment tab. You can learn how by viewing or:

Video Tip: Grouping Radio Buttons and Conditional Fields
Video Tip: Signer Attachment

 
I think that this should be clear enough for your signers. However, if you would like to double confirm,
I would follow @HDosch recommendation and add them in the routing order again. 
**Just know that they will receive two envelopes to sign.

I'm trying to understand how many user accounts we would need.  Our application is used by multiple sales reps/account managers etc to create orders. I'd like to use the api to upload these documents directly from our app for e-signature.  My question is this:  Does each user on our system need a ds user account, or can we use a single sending account, eg. 'sales@example.com'? Thanks for your help.;228;2;lau03229;0;question;;;;;;

The limitations are that you will have no way to distinguish which of your sales reps/account managers actually sent the envelope via DocuSign and they would have no way to view or follow up on those envelopes. You would need someone to manage all of those envelopes. Plus the recipients of those envelopes will always see that system user as the Sender of the envelopes they receive. If you want to be able to track which envelopes were sent by specific sales reps/account managers and allow them to manage their own envelopes, you would need to add them as users to your account. Your application could still use a single user but you would want to enable that user to have Send On Behalf Of rights and account wide rights. Then, your application would log in as that system user and send the envelopes on behalf of the specific individual sales rep/account manager. The envelope will appear to have come from that sales rep/account manager and they are the owner of the envelope. Your application can show to each person the envelopes they own so they can review and manage them. Regards,Michael";213;N/A;mlevy;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

I appreciate that we won't be able to distinguish between users on the DocuSign end but to be honest thats not to much of an issue for us as our user management happens on our end.

I have the information filled in for the variables listed at the top of the sample code, but when I navigate to the embedded link given I am sent to a page where the sign tabs are not visible. I can't think of why this might be other than the variables weren't given all the information needed.  Here's how I've been using the code:For the embedded signing .js file I'm pretty sure all I need to give it are: the email, password, iteregatorKey, templatetRoleName, and envelopeId. As for the variables absent from this list, I'm not sure what to do with them.recipientName - what would this be used for when signing? the person who has the embedded URL is obviousy the recipient that would like to sign the doc; so I leave this blank.tempateId - this seems like it's only for sending because you'd want to send a templated doc. Also, the recipients don't necessarily have access to the template the sender used.async, request and baseURL seem like they never need to be touched by meA useful resonse would include explanations for what each is used for (there are comments in the code, but they seem to not tell the whole story). Also, I have tried many different combinations with both the variables I am using and the variables I listed as not using and couldn't get it to work.

These email formats are defined as part of the Branding configuration in your DocuSign account under the Resources section (specifically Email Resource file). This file is an XML document that contains the HTML layout for every email generated by the DocuSign system. If your DocuSign account is enabled to edit the Branding, an account admin can make changes to these email formats. You will likely want to make these change in multiple different parts of the file as there is a very large number of different emails that can possibly be sent from DocuSign. You could comment out or delete the section of the HTML that renders the Sender name and email address. If you want some standard fixed text to always be displayed, you can add that as well. I'm not sure what you mean by "" their representative email address"". If this is a fixed value? Then you can hardcode that into the email resource file. If it's variable then you cannot dynamically populate a value that is not the sender or recipient of the DocuSign envelope.

The walkthroughs have 9 common use cases for the DocuSign REST API, with samples in 5 different langauges (PHP, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Python).  If that's what you were looking at which one were you reviewing and what problems were running into?
 
I believe what you are trying to do is possible but if you could clarify a little bit that would be helpful.  When you ask if users can fill out a form then have that info be auto-generated in DocuSign, do you mean you want to generate info on a document for signature?  If so, the answer is yes, and you want to use tabs in your signature documents called ""Data Fields"".  
 
You can dynamically populate different types of information into Data Fields using API calls.  In your code what you would do is reference a data field that you added to a template you've already saved, OR you can add the data field to a document right there in the API call, then you can poplulate its value by specifying its labelName and giving it a value.  
 
A short while ago there was another post that I responded to where a user was trying to populate Data Fields, and even though they were using Ruby the thread pretty much explains how to populate them if you read through it.  Please see this link:

What I am looking to do is have a form on the website where users can fill out most of the information that will be on the DocUsign document/template and it will auto copy the users entered contact information, lease duration (of at least three months) and auto generate the $$ amounts in the lease.  I'm guessing this will require a great deal of coding and research since I do now have that kind of knowledge. Is there any simple way to do this?

In terms of if there's a simple way to do this, if you're not a programmer then that definitely makes things more difficult.  These forums are really for developers who know how to code and are now trying to integrate with our API, in programming language of their choice.  My initial thoughts are that this wouldn't require a great deal of coding as you've put it, but if you need to learn how to code in a particular language first then it will obviously take a lot more time.  And sorry but I couldn't really recommend any good education material, I'd say just googling tutorials for various languages would be your best bet shy of actual courses.  
 
Realistically, I'd recommend one of two choices:  1)  hire a developer who can integrate all this for you or 2) accomplish your goals through the DocuSign member console instead of programatically through the API.
 
How many lease agreements are you sending out on a monthly or weekly basis?  If it's not too high a number you can use the console and templates and just make minor changes to each document before you send them out.  Anyways, hope this helps...

Unfortunately you can not change this.  Additionally, the only branding options at your disposal are the ones that are available through the Branding feature in the console, and it looks like you guys are already aware of that page.  However the team did also mention this
 
- In 13.1 with multi-branding, you'd be able to set the branding to be used via the API when creating an envelope. Multiple brands may be create via the web console, assuming this feature is enabled for the account. Look for this around February.
 
So it looks like sometime in February you'll have the option to create multiple brand themes...

For hiding/showing things, you can use the Parent Tag and Parent Value settings of the tabs.  For instance, let's say you have a Data Field tab, and a Signature tab on your document.  You can specify to show or hide the signature tab if the Data Field has value ""XXX"".  
 
And for your alignment/spacing question, in general Data Fields will re-size to how long or short the text in them is.  On top of that, if you look at your Data Field's tab properties, under the Formatting Properties section, you'll see that you can also limit the number of lines, number of characters per line, and total number of characters to be allowed in the Data Field, either through the Console or with an API call.

Yes I did achieve conditional display by means of conditional fields. About spacing however, I think I need to explain it in detail.

Issue now is if 8.1.3. is 1 line text, there will be 2 line ""EXTRA"" spacing between 8.1.3 and 8.1.4. For 3 line text this works absolutely fine in terms of spacing. So question really is can I avoid 2 line extra spacing when 8.1.3 will have 1 line text. Also, surprsingly, when I set the font for both conditional data fields, font gets set correctly for 1 line text however, it doesn't get applied to 3 line text.

Are all of your bullet points dynamically populated in the document through your code / API request, or do you have a document that's being supplied to you that already has these bullet points written out with the extra lines in it?  
 
If you are receiving this document with the bullets already written out and the spacing already in there (i.e. the document already has the 3 lines spaced out in between 8.1.3 and 8.1.4) then I don't think you could remove the two extra lines based on some condition- those are already baked into the document.  With the DocuSign tabs you can add text fields and content to the content, but you can't do things like modify the spacing of the document.  
 
If this is indeed your case then you might want to consider a tool like MailMerge in your workflow.  With that tool you should be able to create either a document with 1 line in between 8.1.3. and 8.1.4 or 3 lines in between based on a condition...";399;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

When I don't give any formatting to the text content, the data does does expand, but it does not fit properly in the document. The document formatting gets disturbed to a great extent. Due to more data, alignment and formatting does not happen correct. Another thing I tried is that:I took 2 data fields which would display different text, as per some condition. I kept the location of the two data fields exactly the same, because only one would be displayed at a time(at one particular position in the document). For my formatting, I have given the formatting parameters as per the maximum length of the characters that I can expect for either of the fields. This setting is same for both. But it so happens, that when the data reduces, it shows me the extra space that I configured keeping in mind the maximum length of data. Is there a solution to this? Can this be corrected through DocuSign? Please let me know. Thanks.;492;N/A;ketkeea;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I cannot send you the original document. But I have attached a sample document where I have replicated my issue (NO Formatting in the data field).In the attached document, the text beginning with ""Sun's vice-president"" has gone outside the scope of the document. The text gets cut. Looks disrupted. Was trying to ask you if we can fix this in DocuSign? Also the scenarios where I have used formatting specifying the number of lines, characters per line etc. In this case, the place where I have maximum 3 lines of data, the text is displayed properly within the scope of the document, but when I try to set the font as per the document's, it doesn't. It takes its own font. Hence, I find a font mismatch.Also, when I get text which spans for just 1 line, I get 2 lines of extra space in the document. Can this be fixed? It is basically the trouble of extra spaces that come in the document. Please let me know. Thanks.

We would just pass it from our Java code. The data field would be configured initially itself with no formatting. In that case, the words go out of scope as I showed you in the attachement the other day. Anyway,it is now decided that we woud be okay giving those extra spaced lines in the document when the data is less. Thanks so much for all your responses.

We do not have any issues doing this in DocuSign. We have an iusse when we pass a value from our code to a label which has been assigned to many data fields using DocuSign APIs. Just for your reference, following is the sample code we write in order to set a value to a label assigned to many data fields:private TextTab sampleMethod(final String label, final String value) {final TextTab textTab = new TextTab();textTab.setTabLabel(label); --> label is same for all data fieldstextTab.setValue(value); --> value same tootreturn textTab;} Doing so, we set the label(same for all data fields), and give it a value and pass it through code. But then when we open our document for signing, we find that only the first data field with the assigned label gets the value, rest of the fields with same label in the document are empty, for them the value does not get populated.

Looking at the tabs page in the SOAP API guide, found here, it mentions this about the TabLabel:
 



TabLabel
TabLabel

This is the name of the custom tab. This can be a maximum of 500 characters.
Notes:


Making custom tab's TabLabel the same will cause the all like fields to update when the user enters data.


For Type of ""Custom"" and CustomTabType of ""Radio"" make the TabLabels the same for any radio buttons you want to group together. The Name value will be what is returned for the radio selected in a group.






So if you give them all the same label and make them editable (by setting ""locked"" to false) then when a recipient types a value  into one text box ALL of them will get updated with that value.  However if the text boxes are not editable and you want to set the values in your API call, and you'll need to supply a value for each one you want to populate.  In the test I mentioned earlier in this thread, I explained that I added two text tabs to a document, provided a value for each, and they both displayed with the value.  However when I supplied only one of them with a value that one updated while the other text box was empty.
 
So as mentioned, you must have something else in your code that's still off.  The only other thing I can think of is if you have multiple recipients and you are not specifying the same recipientId for the other text tabs possibly?
 
Other than that, if you're still struggling I would greatly simplify your program (or make a new test program) and start with just two text tabs and one recipient, specify the value for both of the tabs, and see if you can get that to work.  If so, start adding the rest of the logic back in.  If not, let me know what happens in that simple test and we can take it from there...

If so, I believe you want to use the tab called ""Data Fields"".  With Data Fields, you can specify their location (either directly using X, Y coordinates or through anchor strings in the doc) and if you want you can require your recipients to fill them out, or fill out only certain ones, etc.  
 
Are you making calls through the API or are you attempting to do this through the DocuSign Member Console?  If through the Console try testing it out by adding a tab to your document called ""Data Field"" from the left hand side of the screen.  If through the API, you'll want to add a Data Field tab to the JSON or XML formatted body of your http request.

The envelopeId is a property of the whole envelope, not a particular document, and as far as I know it does not get written to your signed documents.
 
However, there is a certificate that is automatically created for each envelope which contains the envelopeId as well as other information.  Can you not simply download that and then process the envelopeId on the client side?  
 
You're mentioning that after the document(s) are signed you download them, re-name, and store in a different system.  Can you not download the Certificate right after (or before) you download the documents, then process that envelopeId in your app?  There's an operation you can do that downloads just the certificate as a PDF document, and there's another operation that downloads the Certificate combined with all the document(s) in the envelope.  Have a look these to see if they might work for your needs...

Let me provide a little more clarification. Our operations team uses the docusign console to get the documents processed. We do not have any Docusign API integration. Once the documents are signed, they manually download the zip file from the Docusign console, which includes the certificate. They extract the zip file, sometimes rename the pdf file, and upload it to the CRM system. In some cases, they just upload the pdf file, and in other cases, they upload the zip file containing the certificate. They then discard the downloaded file. Note, none of this occurs using any DocusignAPI's or integration - it was/is done manually.  The issue we are now facing is we want to be able to tie the document back to the original envelopeid, and store the corresponding envelopeid for the document, future integration with the Docusign API's. While the envelopeid is imprinted in the signed pdf document, we are looking for a way to extract this from the document, which is why I posted the question. We have thousands of documents that are stored in the system, for which we do not know the envelopeid. We need to extract the envelopeid for it. Is there a way this can be done?

More specifically, you need to extract envelopeIds out of the Certificate PDF.  If that's the case, this seems outside the scope of DocuSign.  Instead it sounds like you need a 3rd party tool that can read PDF files and parse their information, unless I'm mis-understanding you still?...  Once the Certificate is saved as a PDF, it's just like any other valid PDF file and whatever tools normally work on them should work on this file as well...;482;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Are they being asked to log in everytime they are sent something to sign, or is when they are trying to view a document?  Your signers should not be prompted to log in to sign if your setting is set to 'Not Required to Login'.  If they already have an account, they should be able to access the document from the email link.

Powerforms seems to be a very useful feature. The tutorial on Powerforms seems to require the user getting the link to manually enter the details on the form. My ideal approach would be to have the fields pre-populated by the data entered previously by the user so that all the recipient of the form needs to do is sign the form and submit. Noticed 2 posts online which look similar to what I am trying to achieve: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18925536/docusign-dynamically-populate-fields-in-document  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18314753/embedded-signing-rest-api-php/18319313#18319313 Although the links above refer to the embedded signing view, I think they could work in non-embedded contexts too. Do you think the approach of adding textTabs in a template would serve the purpose? Or is there some catch to that approach that I am over-looking?

My account had a different feature enabled that caused these extra settings to appear. They are not required for API usage and not an available feature.] First make sure that the account is enabled to use the API. Under Preferences >> Features look for this setting:  You also need to make sure the user account that you specify in the API call credentials has rights granted to access the API. Check the user's permission profile by going to Preferences >> Users. In the list of users, click Open next to the account you are using for the API calls, then click the Permissions button at the top. Make sure the option is set to Submit DocuSign API Requests. This must be enbled for any user account that will be used to make API calls. You may also need to enable some of the other options as well if this user account will access or manage envelopes for other users in the account (Account-Wide Rights) or needs to send envelopes on behalf of other users in the account (Send On Behalf Of Rights).;367;N/A;mlevy;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

In order to ensure your question is answered quickly and efficiently by our community, here are a few tips.
 

Lost in Translation: Focus on questions about a problem you're facing. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do. Always include an introduction such as ""I am a  (occupation) trying (desired result)"", the edition you are on (Trial, Professional, Workgroup, Enterprise, etc.), browser, screen shots to further demonstrate your point, error messages if relevant, and your level of expertise.


Be specific: If you ask a vague question, you will get a vague answer. But if you give details and context, the community can provide a very useful answer. For example when troubleshooting an issue with an envelope,template,etc reference related details, whenever possible.


Have an open mind: The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn't mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn't always possible. When in doubt, ask people to explain how/where they learned something. Even if the community doesn't agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember: they're just trying to help.


StackOverlflow.com: Any API questions should be posted on our stackoverflow.com with the tag #DocuSignAPI. Stack Overflow has a robust system with experienced professionals who can answer technical questions quickly and efficiently, and this change is intended to get your questions answered faster by a wider audience.

When I export to PDF, the generated file is saved as PDF Version 1.4 (Acrobat 5.x). I am then using Docusign's Print Driver to upload the PDF to Docsign. Embedded in the document are anchor tokens for the signature tabs. The print driver does not work well with PDF versions below 1.5. It converts the document to an image so none of the text can then be parsed to look for the anchors. I am using the built-in export feature of OpenOffice because it's the only way to preserve the form fields.  Using the Acrobat printer does not preserve the fields. Docusign is licensing the PDF Converter API from Amyuni.  I believe this can be changed by the Docusign developers in the code. Anyone have ideas on how to get this accomplished? -Eric  EDIT:  If I upload the same document via the portal instead of using the driver, it is able to read the anchors properly.;431;4;escallin;0;question;;;;;;

I am using the iText library to create and combine documents. With this library, I am able to specify the PDF version that is created.

We need to figure out why the Print Driver converts some PDF's to images while others it does not. The documents I am creating are straight text, with no graphics or odd fonts.

Do the fileds disapper when the document is signed? Do the tags ever show up? I am confused by your second message.
 
What you can do, is create your own anchorTags as part of the envelope definition, so at every occurance of a specific textIdentifier, the tags will appear.

Let me try to clarify the situation even further... My PDF document is a form; that is to say, is contains text boxes that are designed to accept user input when opened using Acrobat Reader. This PDF is injected up to DocuSign via the CreateAndSendEnvelope API within the PDFBytes XML element. When this document is opened, using the DocuSign web browser interface (to be signed), the PDF looks exactly as it should; however, the PDF input fields aren't active. If you click on these text areas/boxes through the DS browser interface, nothing happens - you can't provide the required input before signing. Anchor tags are being specified and these work fine for their intended purpose. It is the PDF form fields that seem to get disabled or stripped. Regards, atware";1726;N/A;atware;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

However, there is a new problem that seems quite peculiar. It relates to composite templates and anchor tabs. I'm using an inline template and I am expressing custom tabs for each form field along with 3 anchor tabs. The response I receive from the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms indicates that all of the custom tabs are recognized successfully - via the TabStatus elements. This is indeed the case as these pdf input fields function just fine when I sign the document through the DS console. The same can't be said for the anchor tabs. These seem to be ignored. Interestingly, they don;t show up as <TabStatus> elements within the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms response. If I change my app to issue the CreateEnvelopeAndSend API without any expression of the custom tabs relating to the PDF form fields, the anchor tabs work just fine (?). I think this indicates that my anchor tabs within both XML requests are conveyed correctly.

2. If you have a DocuSign account, you can sign in to your account and find the completed document under your manage tab in your 'Inbox'.
 
3. If you do not have an account with DocuSign and happened to delete the completed email that was sent when you completed the signing.  You will want to contact the sender of the document and they should have the completed document in their sent folder.
 
If this does not answer your question, please reply back and we will try our best to help in any way we can.

We have lots of tools and information available online that you can easily access.  For starters, have you looked at our iodocs website, located here?
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com
 
That links starts you off in the API explorer which, after filling out your credentials at the top of the page, you can actually make test API calls and it shows you the corresponding requests and responses in json format.  At the top right of that page you'll see a link for the API Explorer, which shows 9 simple use cases for common DocuSign tasks (such as requesting signatures, getting document statuses, etc.) and when you click on them you'll actually see sample code snippets (currently in PHP and JavaScript but we're in the process of adding more language samples).
 
Next we have our online RESTApi guide which can be found here:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/RESTAPIGuide.htm
 
And yet another useful link is github's tutorial for creating and sending an envelope:  
https://github.com/docusign/DocuSign-eSignature-SDK/wiki/Code-Walkthrough-_-Create-And-Send-Envelope
 
As for your specific questions, first off signers do *not* need their account to sign documents- once they sign they'll be asked if they want to create an account for free but they don't have to.  As for the manager, can you shed some light on your document process a bit?  You've mentioned that your manager uploads the document into your system.  If that's all they do, and then the landlord is able to find that document themselves and has access to it, then I think the landlord can create and send an envelope for signature while referencing that document, and in this case I don't believe the manager would need to have their own account.  However I want to make sure I'm understanding that process correctly...
 
One final point I'll make, you actually the option of using the RestAPI or the SOAP API.  Since Rest is more recent we encourage everyone to use that if they can, however the decision is yours of course.  :)

I'm currently looking at the ""Create Account"" on page 39 of the REST_API_Guide_v2.pdf and am wondering if I should maybe create an account for each manager and store the accountid, apipassword, baseurl and userID from the response locally so I can reference it for any future requests for that manager.

The process I used was based on the email address used in this community post.
I believe that you are an admin in Dynamics. For MS Dynamics to link to DocuSign you need to be an admin for both and have a certain type of DocuSign account. I pulled up your DocuSign account (based on your email address) and saw it was a basic DocuSign account. We'd need to get you on a different DocuSign account to connect with a CRM. Do you possibly use a different email address to log in to DocuSign than you do for the community? I should have been more specific and suggest that you create a free trial DocuSign account instead of trying to link to your existing DocuSign account.
As this is a public forum I don't want to divulge any personal information. Can you please write to service@docusign.com for further troubleshooting if needed?

Thank you for using the DocuSign Community Forum.
 
As of right now, there is not a way to auto populate a signature.  You can create a template and add the signautre tag in there to make it easier for the signer, but they would not be able to have a signature auto populate.   This is mainly due to security, and being an electronic method of having someone physically sign a document in person.

Go to Salesforce > DocuSign Admin > Envelopes > Email Settings > Click 'Edit' to the left of the Default Email Subject/Default Email Message/Language2. Remove all text in the 'Default Email Message' box > Save3. Now when you send a template, the template's email message will appear in the email message box after selecting 'Tag' Because DSfS uses API calls, the integration settings will always trump what is in DocuSign, unless nothing is defined in the integration.

I have moved your thread to the DocuSign for Salesforce Forum 
 
The custom email message must be setup in Salesforce when using DocuSign for Salesforce. 
 
Please view step 4 in our Guide Sending a Document from DocuSign for Salesforce >>
 
 
**However, Please note that you can also apply a template in salesforce , which would utilize the message in the first picture. 
Please use step 2 in our guide Add Documents or Attachments to the Envelope

I think your  Adobe Live Cyce document is an Active XFA .PDF (also known as a XFA Form used by some web forms programs) Unfortunately this is a file type that is not supported by DocuSign's conversion process and there are no current remedies. 
 
DocuSign will display a warning upon uploading such a document and, while the PDF will upload successfully, you may lose some form field recognition and/or other data added to this fillable-type PDF.

If you do not provide a clientUserID when you create the envelope, DocuSign will never be able to return a signing URL for embedded signing. You can set this value to whatever you choose to identify the recipient and use the same clientUserID when you you make the call to get the signing session URL for that recipient. The sample code is using the account email address as the recipient email address simply making the assumption that you are using your own login credentials to make the API call and you are also the recipient of this test API-created envelope. When you create the envelope, you should pass the actual recipient's email address and name along with the template role.;118;N/A;mlevy;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I am very new at this and just started to do my integration . One initial problem is that  I need to call a list of all the  form fields id names from eeach of the templates. Is there anyway to do this just from an API call to the server? Another way to explain waht I want to do is as follows:  I will load several templates from PDF forms to the template repository.  Then I need to find a way to extract the names of these fieldnames so that I may match the data repopulation to the coorect field.;398;1;jecalderon;0;question;API.  PDF Form;;;;;

Our reporting features delievers the data in a .csv file and that can be set up on a schedule.
 
However it's unclear if it's acheiveable via the API .The API can run reports, but the results will be in XML or JSON.
Please raise the issue with Stack Overflow to see if the data can be brought into your database to see if such a workflow is possible.

I'm dealing with an issue right now.  We have a bulk send template that has been used a few times (last time in oct 2014).  When we went to use it this week, none of the tags are working.  When we go to the template, we see the tags and labels but the data is not transferring from the envelope to salesforce once completed.  Also, fields on the template that were formatted a certain way, marked required, etc are not that way when we send to users.  It's very odd. We'll be creating a case with docusign today.  In the past, when this has happened, we just recreated all the tag fields and it would work.  It's not working this time though.;596;N/A;cdcutlip;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Here's my experience:Switched over to the new interface from the classic client to work on a template.  As I had done numerous times before, I left the edit screen opened too long and the session timed out.  When I came back and interestingly, when I had to log back in after the session timed out, I was brought right back to the edit screen.  I chose to discard the changes since I had only intended to log in via the new interface to see what's new, not to make any changes.  Unfortunately, after choosing discard, that template as well as copies of the same template are now gone!  Thank goodness, however, the API was still able to see it, else I'd be in big trouble!

I'm using SOAP API (used WSDL2APEX) to create and send the envelope, and I can't seem to find how to set the Envelope External Source Id before sending the envelope.  I noticed in the SOAP API docs that it says there are reserved custom field names (##SFAccount, ##SFContract, ##SFOpportunity, ##SFCase) that I'm guessing evaluate to the Envelope External Account, Envelope External Contract, Envelope External Opportunity, and Envelope External Case respectively.

It sounds like you could use our Powerform feature. This is an advanced feature available on paid plans where you can create a URL or HTML to your envelope.
 
There are three ways to send DocuSign PowerForms to recipients: by email, as an attachment, or embedded in a web page.
 
To begin sending
Access the list of PowerForms: from the Manage tab expand the Templates heading in the navigation panel and then click the PowerForms link.
PowerForm administrators can see all PowerForms for all senders in their account. PowerForm senders can only see and use the PowerForms for which they are the sender. 
Sort the PowerForms in the list by clicking on the column headings. You can also search for PowerForms, by date last used/signed, document name, sender name, signing mode, or status.
Sending by email

Select the PowerForm you want to send by clicking on it.
Click the Actions button and select Email. A new email is opened using your default email client. The Email Subject and Text from the PowerForm is automatically entered in the email, and the URL link to the PowerForm is added at the end of the email text. You can review and edit the subject text for the email.
Add the recipients email address.
Send the email.

Sending by attachment
This option is similar to sending a PowerForm by email, but in this case the PowerForm is attached to an email rather than being linked from it.
IMPORTANT: You can only use this method if the PowerForm type is PDF. Web PowerForms cannot be downloaded and attached to an email.

Select the PowerForm you want to send by clicking on it.
Click the Actions button and select Download. Then save the PowerForm to your system.
Create a new email using your email client and attach the PowerForm to the email.
Fill out and send the email normally.

Sending by URL or HTML

Select the PowerForm you want to send by clicking on it.
Click the Actions button and select Links. A dialog box is displayed with a URL and HTML link to the PowerForm.

The user can copy and paste the URL in an email or copy the HTML link and add it to a web page.
Removing the Initial Name/Email Screen
DocuSign PowerForms can become even easier for signers by removing the initial screen asking for the signer's name and email address.
To use this option, the PowerForm template that is being sent must have the First Name, Last Name and Email Address tags or the Full Name and Email Address tags added for the first recipient in routing order. When the recipient begins signing, the screen where the recipient is asked to enter their name and email information is skipped and the recipient goes directly to the signing screen.
The following restrictions and limitations are associated with this enhancement:

It can only be used with Direct PowerForm template.
It can work in PowerForms with multiple recipients where the first recipient is not defined and subsequent recipients are defined.
It will not work in PowerForms where subsequent recipients are required, but not specified in the template. The initial signer will be prompted to enter the name and email address information for the required subsequent recipients.
It will not work if the Signature Adoption Configuration for your account is set so that a signer must draw their signature.
It can be used with access code authentication, but not with ID check authentication.";216;N/A;DocuDaniel;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I have a requirement to update the data field tag in a document by calling the Docusign API from Salesforce after it has been sent for signature. Let's say the routing order of signers are from signer 1 to signer 4. Initially the value of that data field tag will be null and after signer 3 ""completed"" his signature , I have to trigger the API call from Salesforce and update the tag with the value which is retrieved from custom field value of an object in salesforce so that Signer 4 will be able to see the value in the data field tag before he signs the document.  I used Merge fields for docusign to import the salesforce data into that tag.But as I said before, initial value will be null (because the salesforce data of that merge field will also be null at that time) and I have to ""halt"" the signing process, update the tag and then continue to remaining signer.  Is there any way that i could ""refresh"" the envelope, so that the value in the data field tag gets updated?

That's the very reason for needing to check them before blindly voiding them*.I spoke with enterprise support and learned that our API limit per hour is outrageously high and that it is, after all, only per-hour.  Even with a few hundred API status checks, we still would have plenty left for this particular nightly job.  If we were to ever exceed, we could spawn our own queing cross hours...Bulk API looks really promising but turns out to be unusable for our use case.* I was also made aware that the ability to turn an envelope's automatic expiration on and off with CorrectAndResendEnvelope is now available!  ..

Have you had a chance to read our existing documentation on SOBO (Send on Behalf Of).
 
There are a few things there tha stand out, outside clarification on how SOBO works. 
 
The DocuSign Send On Behalf Of functionality permits automated sending through the DocuSign API by an integrated sender on behalf of another sender. The Send On Behalf Of functionality is only available to accounts that use the DocuSign API to send envelopes and can be enabled for an account member by a DocuSign Customer Administrator through the DocuSign console or by contacting your DocuSign Account Manger.

Correct and Resend Envelope: Changing Routing Order on Carbon Copy recipient doesn't take-- it always sends my corrected CarbonCopy recipient to the last position (whereas I need him to be just prior to the last position).  Initially, routing order among two signers (homeowners), CC, and another signer (company executive) is 3, 5, 6, 7, respectively.  I would think that Correct and Resend as-is would simply resend, but instead it jacks with the routing order.  So I tried tinkering and intentionally setting Routing Order on CC and executive, but no matter what I do, CC follows executive. Ok next, I tried tinkering with the first homeowner (3) and setting its Routing Order to something high like 20.  That worked like a charm.  Then when I went to Correct and Resend it down to 2, an error reported that routing order had to be at least 5 (the lowest routing order on the envelope?). There appear to be some undocumented interdependencies that I could use a hand understanding.  In the end, for this specific use case, I just want to be able to provide a Correct and Resend that does not rearrange CarbonCopy to the last position.

I believe this may just boil down to a couple field settings in DocuSign but would you confirm these assumptions first?
 

Both the Account and the custom object exist prior to sending with DocuSign.
Conversely, that the custom object does not exist at send.
That there is a relationship between the Account and custom object.
That the relationship between the two objects is a lookup field from the custom object to Account.

Given all of those it may simply be down to configuring your merge fields in DocuSign.  You may currently have, for instance, one field configured to pull values from the Account object's fields and then other objects to pull from your custom object.  For example:
 
Account -> Name
Custom Object -> Descrciption
 
If that is the case, then it is (hopefully) simply a matter of modifying the second field to start from the Account - like so:
 
Account -> Custom Object -> Description
 
Note that because there could be multiple custom objects related to Account, you can actually drag multiple ""rows"" worth of this field into the template.  Each one will have a row number set (1, 2, 3, etc.) by default allowing you pull in the various objects related to the Account.
 
Please let us know if that solves the issue.  If those assumptions are incorrect then we can dig in some more.  For reference, you shouldn't need to create/modify Connect update settings to get this functionality to work.";1149;N/A;jeffAtDocusign;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

In regard to your first and second bullet points, the custom object doesn't actually exist at signing. On the return trip back to SFDC, DocuSign actually needs to insert new rows under the custom object. For example, the custom object could be Widgets, and DocuSign would need to insert the customer's 2012 widget order....400 of Widget A, 500 of Widget B, and so on. There is a relationship between the Account and Custom Object. I'll look back over my Docusign settings per your comments, but if you could confirm that creating new Custom Object records and relating those back to an Account is possible, I'd appreciate it.;1081;N/A;jbsig262;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Unfortunately we are unable to troubleshoot Conga but we can see if your DocuSign for SalesForce is working and therefore eliminate any variables.
 
Can you please try and send to DocuSign by bypassing the Conga button? To do this you may need to edit your object page lay out. For example, if you are sending from an opportunity and the ""Send with DocuSign"" button is not on that page you can add it by clicking ""edit layout"" on the top > selecting ""buttons"" and then drag and drop ""Send with DocuSign"" on to the page. Once it is on the page please click that button. This will take you to a screen where you can add your documents and recipients. From this page please click ""tag"". At this point you will either be taken to the DocuSign tagging screen, or you will get an error. If you get an error at this point we'd need to do further research on the DocuSign end of things to figure out what is going on. If you do not get an error than we know the problem is most likely related to the Conga merge. 
 
If you need to contact Conga their support info can be found here: http://home.appextremes.com/support/

The problem we have is that we cannot find a way to let our service do this without, at some point, asking the customer for his DocuSign password. If we do this, we can then authenticate as the user, get an encrypted form of the password and store that for use in future requests. We would much rather not do this though, and expected to find some mechanism whereby the customer can authenticate our application (and others) to use his account (and also revoke that access), and this would provide an application-specific token of some kind for us to use.

So when the document review ends, the owner can request an e-signature from all reviewers (one or many). We talked to the folks at DocuSign who advised us to retreive the recipient name based on our email before we submit the envelop using the CreateAndSendEnvelope() method. We've been told this approach is better for legal reasons (signature is binded to a legal name/email pair). This brings several questions:1. This approach means that we need at least two API requests to create/send an envelope once authenticated. Right?2. Is GetRecipientList() the right method to get recipient records (we pass a list of emails)? 3. Several scenarios to handle the recipient record returned by the API:   a. no name associated to the email => shall we leave it empty and let the signer enter that information himself? Other option is to pass the name we have in DB   b. one name returned => we use it   c. multiple names returned => things are gettign weird; how do we handle this properly? Would it be ok to leave it empty and let the signer choose his name (if this is how DocuSign handles this scenario)?4. for 3., I think that the signer could manually select the name on DocuSign for each recipient  - we don't like this approach; it's extra-work and this is error-prone (3 names, which one do I choose?)

You need to make a GetRecipientList() call for every recipient, since the function does not process a bached list. 
 
GetRecipientList() is not the right method to get the Recipient records, since it only gives you a list of names associated with that email address. Here is a description of the function call. 
 
When multiple names are returned, you may want to display the first one. the user can alwasy change it. There really is no ""best practice"" around that. 
 
When no name is being returned.... again, you can leave it empty and let the user enter it, or pre-populate the name fileds. At the end the user can change the name to his or her preference. Again, this is more a matter of implementation preference than best practice since a user can always change the name if necessary.
 
 
Please let me know if this helps, or if you you have other questions.

Yes, you are right 
 
An Integrator Key is a Unique Identifier for each DocuSign integration. It is used (and required) for all API calls (SOAP or REST) to any DocuSign service. Having an Integrator Key lets DocuSign ""tag"" each API call from all integrations, and helps provide both an additional layer of security and helps DocuSign support our partners. An Integrator Key is REQUIRED for all integrations, and if you want to move to Production (make calls to www.docusign.net) you also must be certified and get that Integrator Key authorized by DocuSign for Production.
 
All Integrator Keys are used for development first, and as a result, they are all managed (and requested) in DocuSign's DEMO service. If you already have a developer account on demo, log in to request an Integrator Key. If you do not have a Demo Developer Account, go to the DocuSign Developer Center and request a free account.
 
After you have developed your integration using your Demo Integrator Key, you must get that Integrator Key certified before moving to production. In order to become certified, you must be a member of our Developer Program. With that membership, you get access to all sorts on ongoing support, certification help, and access to production. To join the program, or start the certification process, refer to the certification steps in the DocuSign Community.
 
Learn how to get Certified
 
 
I recommend visiting our Dev Center, where YOU can sign up for a FREE Developer  Account and view Training and Documentation for our SOAP and REST API.

This is a known issue that we are actively trying to address.
I have updated your details to the report for our development team. I'll continue to monitor and will update this thread with all progress. 
 
If you would like to further troubleshoot, please enable API Request Logging 
 
If you are using an API Integration with DocuSign outside of regular DS tools, administrators may now download API requests associated with their integration directly though the DocuSign console. This is particularly useful when troubleshooting specific issues within an integration, or if DocuSign Support requests an API trace log. You must be a DocuSign Administrator to enable and use this feature.
 
Learn how in our Guide: API Request Logging

You may be interested in our Retrieve feature. You could create  DocuSign Tag Name column in the CSV file and have Fetch pull the Tag info so that you can look-up the individual envelopes. 
 
 
**Fetch is a DocuSign product that allows you to download envelope information from DocuSign by creating Fetch settings. Fetch settings are ""bookmarks"" where you save search information. When creating Fetch settings, you can select the date range and the envelope statuses to search, along with how and where to save the search results. A Fetch setting can be saved for later use and used to build a command line for schedule tasks with the built-in Fetch Console Script Builder. The DocuSign Fetch application and Fetch settings can be set up with the assistance of DocuSign Professional Services. Contact your Account Manager for more information about working with DocuSign Professional Services and Fetch.

The key dates for the DocuSign Signed By certificate update are given below:

Today: In the Demo environment, you can either use the current or new Signed Bycertificate. You can update your web application and test the change.
Today: In the Production environment, you can either use current or new Signed Bycertificate. We recommend you update your web application for this change as soon as possible.
October 27, 2014: In the Demo environment, DocuSign will only support the newSigned By certificate. If you have not updated your web application, you will have a service outage.
November 3, 2014: In the Production environment, DocuSign will only support the new Signed By certificate. If you have not updated your web application by this date, you will have a service outage.

Actions

Log on to your DocuSign account, then check your DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration Settings (as outline in Step 1a) and check the API Notification parameters included your API requests to DocuSign (as outlined in Step 1b).
If either applies to your DocuSign account then follow Steps 2 through 5.

 
If you have any questions, please contact your DocuSign Account Manager.
 
Step 1: Check Your DocuSign Account Settings

Log on to the Classic DocuSign Experience web applications to check your account settings to determine if you are using the current DocuSign Signed By certificate with the DocuSign Connect and/or DocuSign API services  
 

Demo environment
Production environment


In the upper right corner, click your profile image and select Preferences


 

IMPORTANT: You must check both DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration (Step 1a) and API Envelope Notification (Step 1b).  If you have multiple DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration then you must check the settings for each configuration.
 

Step 1a: DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration

In the navigation pane on the left side of the page, under the Account Administration heading, click Features.


 

Scroll down to DocuSign API section and check to see if the DocuSign Connect is selected.

If DocuSign Connect is selected, you must check each DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration setting. Click DocuSign Connect link to go to the DocuSign Connect Settings page.
 


Click on a DocuSign Connect Setting. 


Note: You must conduct this check for all your Connect configurations.
 


 

On the right side of the DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration page, check if to see if the Sign Messages with X509 Certificate, Include X509 Certificate in SOAP Header, or Require Mutual TLS options are selected.


 

If any of these options are selected, then you must download and install DocuSign's new Signed By certificate (as outlined in Step 2), test your application in the DocuSign Demo environment (as outlined in Step 3a), update your Production environment (as outlined in Step 4a), and clean up the current Signed By certificate (as outline in Step 5).

 
Step 1b:  API Notification

Check your API requests to see if they are set to receive API Envelope Notification with either of the following parameters are set to ""true"":
 

""signMessageWithX509Cert""
""includeCertificateWithSoap""


If any of these parameters are set to ""true"", then you must download and install DocuSign's new Signed By certificate (as outlined in Step 2), test your application in the DocuSign Demo environment (as outlined in Step 3b), update your Production environment (as outlined in Step 4b), and clean up the current Signed By certificate (as outline in Step 5).

Step 2: Download and Install DocuSign's New Signed By Certificate
 
Download and install DocuSign's new Signed By certificate on all web servers running your DocuSign Connect listener(s) or web application using the DocuSign API based on the following guidelines:
 

Go to DocuSign Public Certificates web page in DocuSign Trust Center and click theNew DocuSign Connect X.509 link to download new Signed By certificate.
Click the Symantec CA Bundle link to download the Symantec Issuing CA and Root CA needed to create the trust chain.
Import the new Signed By certificate and Symantec CAs the web servers in your Development and Test environments. If you need help to install new Signed By certificate, Symantec Issuing CA, or Symantec Root CA, please go to GoDaddy's SSL Support web page and select your web server type (Microsoft IIS, Tomcat, etc.)

You should maintain the current DocuSign Signed By certificate on your web servers at this time.
 
Step 3: Test Your Web Application in the DocuSign Demo Environment
 
Based on the results of Step 1a and 1b, please update the applicable portions of your Demo environment as described below:
 

Note: DocuSign will switch all account to use our new Signed By certificate in the DocuSign Demo environment on
 
Monday, October 27, 2014. If you have not updated your code by this date, you may experience a DocuSign Connect outage until you update the certificate and trust chains.
 

Step 3a: Update DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration

Log on to the Classic DocuSign Experience web application Demo environment. In the upper right corner, click your profile image and select Preferences.  Under the Account Administration heading, click Connect. On the DocuSign Connect Settingspage click on you Connect configuration.
DocuSign has added a new Connect setting for using the new Signed By certificate. Select Use New X509 Certificate (Valid from 8/26/2014 to 11/11/2016) and save the configuration.


 

Repeat this for all your Connect configurations.
Test the new configuration with the new certificate by:

create new transactions in DocuSign Demo environment
download messages to your Test environment
verify you received the expected Connect messages



 
Step 3b:  Update API Notification

If you are using the DocuSign API with either ""signMessageWithX509Cert"": ""true"" or ""includeCertificateWithSoap"": ""true"" then log on to the Classic DocuSign Experience web application Demo environment. In the upper right corner, click your profile image and select Preferences.  Under the Account Administration heading, clickFeatures.  Scroll down to DocuSign API section and select Use New X509 Certificate for Envelope Events.


 

Test the new configuration with the new certificate by:
 

create new transactions in DocuSign Demo environment
download messages to your Test environment
verify you received the expected Connect messages



 
Step 4: Update the Production Environment for Your Web Application
 
Once you have completed Step 3 and validated the new configurations in Demo, please follow the appropriate steps below to update your Production integration.
 

IMPORTANT: DocuSign plans to switch all accounts to use our new Signed Bycertificate in the DocuSign Production environment on Monday, November 3, 2014. If you have not updated your code by this date, you may experience a DocuSign Connect outage until you update the certificate and trust chains.
 

Step 4a: Update DocuSign Connect Settings Configuration

If you are using DocuSign Connect, you need to turn on DocuSign's new Signed Bycertificate before you can test.
Log on to the Classic DocuSign Experience web application Production environment. In the upper right corner, click your profile image and select Preferences.  Under the Account Administration heading, click Connect. On the DocuSign Connect Settingspage click on you Connect configuration.
DocuSign has added a new Connect setting for using the new Signed By certificate. Select Use New X509 Certificate (Valid from 8/26/2014 to 11/11/2016) and save the configuration.


 

Repeat this for all your Connect configurations.
Test the new configuration with the new certificate by:

create new transactions in DocuSign Production environment
download messages to your Test environment
verify you received the expected Connect messages



 
Step 4b:  Update API Notification

If you are using the DocuSign API with either ""signMessageWithX509Cert"": ""true"" or ""includeCertificateWithSoap"": ""true"" Log on to the Classic DocuSign Experience web application Production environment. In the upper right corner, click your profile image and select Preferences.  Under the Account Administration heading, clickFeatures.  Scroll down to DocuSign API section and select Use New X509 Certificate for Envelope Events.


 

Test the new configuration with the new certificate by:
 

create new transactions in DocuSign Production environment
download messages to your Test environment
verify you received the expected Connect messages



 
Step 5: Clean up Current Signed By Certificate in Your Environments
Once you have successfully updated to DocuSign's new Signed By certificate, you can remove DocuSign's current Signed By certificate, which expires November 12, 2014, from your Development, Test, and Production environments.
 
If you are using Microsoft IIS web server, Symantec has found an issue with invalid chain messages. Based on this knowledge base article, Symantec highly recommends moving VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certificate Authority - G5 to the Untrusted Store.

I do not think this is currently possilble with our  Custom Account Branding.
 
DocuSign helps you reflect your company brand on the emails and web pages your recipients see when completing documents so your brand is front and center. Add your company logo, change colors, and customize email copy and links. Only DocuSign gives companies this many options to ensure your recipients can easily identify documents coming from your organization.
 
This includes the text in the email notifications that recipients receive. You will need to edit the Master Email Resource File and then upload it into your account.

Please see the earlier comment in the thread. 
 
There is an option to require recipients to view and agree to the terms in the disclosure each time they open an envelope. 
It is located in Account Prefrence >> Account Administration >>Features (on the left column) >> Under Manage Account >>  
 
Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure frequency (List) - This option determines how often a recipient is asked to accept the current disclosure notice. There are two possible selections:


Once: Recipients only need to accept the disclosure the first time they do business electronically with the account.


Always: Recipients must always accept the disclosure notice.


You are interested in the Always  option.

We're still able to use the Conga PointMerge button, but have to manually assign tags when we reach the Docusign page within Salesforce. We've called support, and are waiting feedback. But, in our search found that the standard Docusign button in Salesforce was not working either, and behaving worse then the custom button we're using.  The [Tag] button skips the document view and I immediately see a blank transaction page. The [Send Now] button returns the error: ""Ending position out of bounds: 3"". Has anyone else encountered this? Any fix used?";1513;0;Diana;0;question;;;;;;

When you create recipients for the emedded scenario, you need to pass a value for ClientUserId.
 
Perhaps you did that when you created the Envelope and set the recipient's values, but from this trace I can see that you are not including the ClientUserId in your RequestRecipientToken call.";1360;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

Here is a link that gives you more details regarding your embedded scenario.
 
Here is PHP sample code that shows RequestRecipientToken scenario in action.  If PHP is not your thing, look through our site and you'll find C# samples.
 
Here is a code walkthrough that goes step by step through the embedded signing scenario.
 
Essentially, you can not create an envelope from the DocuSign Console for the embedded signing scenario. You need to use the API, and as you do....the Recipient.CaptiveInfo.ClientUserId value needs to be set. By setting it, you specify that the signer is embedded.

I think it's best if we do a screen sharing session to see what your configuration is. Normally DocuSign is just another window inside of Salesforce and should not open in a new tab.

I would like to point out some other very valuable information.
 
The <Notification> block in an API Call is used to configure the Reminders and Expiration (R&E) values for an Envelope. This block must be configured correctly in order to work as desired.  The first element in the block, <UseAccountDefaults>, is used to determine if the R&E values to be used are taken from the DocuSign Account or from the API Call. Using the boolean value of 'true' causes the Account settings to be used; using the boolean value of 'false' uses the settings configured in the <Notification> setting of the API Call.  When <UseAccountDefaults> is set to false, then the <Reminders> and <Expirations> blocks must be configured. Each has an <... Enabled> element. A boolen value needs to be set for each. If set to 'true,' then the settings will be used; if false, then no settings will be used.

The text of the Access Code page can be modified by using the Signing Resource file.
 
The customer must have Account Branding enabled and using resource files allowed (currently Account Branding is limited to Business plan and Enterprise plan customers).
 
If the customer has Account Branding and resource files enabled; they can download the Signing Resource file, make the appropriate changes to the data lines described below, and upload the modified resource file. That should change what their recipient sees. You can download the resource file by logging into the DocuSign Console, goto Preferences -> Branding -> Download Signing Resource.

These lines allow you to change the text for the dialog box header and message text used for different signer authentication methods.

Both questions pertain to checkboxes in Connect : Custom 1 settings in the admin console:> 3) Check the box for ""Require Acknowledgement"" so any failed connection attempts can be logged and accessible via the {Failures} tab in the Connect panel in Preferences. Neither in demo nor production do we have Req Ack checked, and I can see all outbound requests.  What I see logged is the request xml and my app's response.  Our application currently only returns a static, unintelligent ""<h1>DocuSign Connect</h1>"" message.  When Connect fails to reach our server, we see another error like a 404 or some other (if I recall correctly).  If I enable Req Ack, is there some additional mechanism or response message structure I need to develop, or would merely enabling Req Ack allow Connect to continue to work as it does but, additionally, log failures that might expose the issue I'm experiencing?  > 5) Check the boxes next to the names of individuals with member accounts whose Envelopes should be published.

Require Acknowledgement: Select this option to log posting failures. The acknowledgement failure messages are logged in the Failures tab. When this option is selected, DocuSign will automatically attempt to repost any failures. Alternately, the customer can manually repost from the Failures tab.

You can add other recipients before or after the Bulk Send recipient and an unique envelope will be generated for each of the bulk recipients. 
 
**The average speed of the envelope depends on how many Bulk Recipients there are and the complexity of the envelope workflow but they normally take around 1- 3 seconds. The documents are sent asynchronously on three of our servers.

Good question.
There is an ""Auto-Navigation"" Setting that you can enable for recipients, that guides them through the pages and fields of the envelope.
 
I believe you need to change to ""Navigate all fields"". To adjust the setting, follow the steps below. 
 
 
1. In the DocuSign console, click the the downward arrow by your ID tag, in the upper right hand corner. Select Preferences.
2. In the left hand column, under Account Administration, select Features. 
3. Find the ""Signing auto-navigation rule""  under the Sending and Signing Section , and select the option that fits your needs. (see descriptions below picture)
4. Click Save at the bottom of the screen.
 

 
 
Auto-navigates the signer through the tags/fields, in the order they were created, top to bottom, left to right,
There are seven possible selections for the initial navigation, but subsequent navigation will use the Navigate all fields rule.
 
 
The seven rules are:
 
Navigate required fields:
The initial navigation moves to the next blank or filled-in required field. Optional fields are skipped. Subsequent navigation will use the Navigate all fields rule.
 
Navigate blank required fields:
The initial navigation moves to the next blank required field. Subsequent navigation will use the Navigate all fields rule.
 
Navigate all fields:
The initial and subsequent navigation moves to the next required or optional field.
 
Page Only:
There is no automatic navigation to the next field. The signer must manually navigate through the document.The signer can scroll through the document, click the Next arrow, or use the document map on the right side of the browser to go to specific pages in the document. Subsequent navigation will use the Navigate all fields rule.

Good Question. 
The answer varies, depending on how you are DocuSigning 
 
If you are using the Classic Experience?
If you are using the New Experience?
If you are using one of our mobile Apps?
If you are using one of our Integrations?
 
There is a link that can be viewed through a web browser that will show an xml file with the latest Classic DocuSign Experience and API builds:

The next thing I would check is your Connect Settings. From the DS Console Preferences > Connect. Under the column, ""Select users to integrate"" are your users visible and/or checked?
 
When you installed DS4SF did you install for All Users or Admins Only?
 
And finally, is the package Deployed?
 
Here is another resource for common issue troubleshooting: http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-Integrations/Salesforce-Troubleshooting/td-p/2485
 
If this steps do not resolve, please sent a screenshot of your entire Connect window to service@docusign.com so we may further troubleshoot your issue.

06/04/2012 09:05;false;488;Duplicate recipient created when recipient name contains leading or trailing space;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Duplicate-recipient-created-when-recipient-name-contains-leading/td-p/9135;This is related to another issue (API submissions - Duplicate Recipients) that was opened on 02-03-2011, but was closed by the user (even though the problem still exists). I'm seeing this same problem when sending in an API call with a recipient name with a leading/trailing space.While I can easily fix the leading space issue, (and I have already in my code), I'm more concerned about what's going on here, and what other implications there are for character/encoding issues, and view permissions. If the recipient name has a leading/trailing spacedocusign will create a duplicate recipient2 emails will go outthe link in the first email will 'work'the link in the second email will still allow them to view the doc, but no pre-existing 'tabs' are present (they can add some)the document can't be completed unless they click the first link and sign itSo basically the link in the first email brings the signer in, and they are a 'match' for the signer role, and they can see the existing tabs I have set up for that role. the link from the second email is not a match (most likely due to the space), but they are still allowed to view the doc, and sign and 'mess with' it as they please. Why does this happen?Are there other character encoding/stripping functions going on?If I try a business name like 'Joe & Moe's crabshack <inc>', will the &<> or ', get modified? I'm using the API to create this envelope, and the xml returned to me doesn't indicate that the second recipient was created (though the web page does). If this is intentional, is it documented somewhere? (are clients relying on this behavior, and intentionally sending in recipients with a leading space, so that two emails will go out? - seems unlikely) while that other ticket was closed, I still think there is a bug here that needs to be looked at.;375;3;jmccaffrey;0;question;;;;;;

Two places to start:
 
1) Check to see if your login is configured in Connect. Go to Preferences > Connect and see if the checkbox next to Configure Login is checked. If not, click Configure Login and re-enter the correct SF Admin email and password.
 
2) If this fails, you may need to delete the current DocuSignAccountConfiguration and recreate it by following this process:
 
1) Login to the Salesforce Test Sandbox, Go to All Tabs > DocusignAccountConfigurations and delete all the existing DocuSign account configurations present (Make sure to view All and hit Go). If you do not see the DocuSignAccountConfigurations Tab, you will need to create it (Setup > Create > Tabs).2) Navigate to the DocuSign Admin tab; this will automatically create a new configuration.3) Return immediately to DocusignAccountConfigurations and edit the newly created configuration.4) Switch environment from ""production"" to ""demo.""5) Return back to the DocuSign Admin tab and follow the onscreen step-by-step process with the correct DEMO DocuSign credentials.
 
If you continue to have issues, I would suggest contacting our support team at service@docusign.com with screenshots and any errors you are seeing.

The REST API is actively being developed and enhanced to provide new features.
The SOAP API is the legacy method that will remain in production but with very minimal enhancements.

We are using Docusign Java API to create and send envelops so everyting is automated through software.What we would like to achieve ideally is for our software to detect that the checkbox was not selected and act on it accordingly.Our checkbox is being created programatically (when generating the envelope) by using a CustomTab of type CHECKBOX and we noticed that there is a flag on this tab called ""setCustomTabRequired"" which we are setting to true in the hope that Docusign will enforce the user to check the box before confirming signing the document. However when we view the document in Docusign and we sign the document without selecting the checkbox the document is being successfully signed and send to us even thoug the check box was never selected. So we are not sure if the flag ""setCustomTabRequired"" is diong what its suppose to do.Is there any other way that we can detect if the checkbox was selected or not programatically?

So I actually do have an answer to your question. The problem that you are running in to is that checkbox tabs (both custom ones and the default one provided by docusign) cannot be set to required. The required setting that you are using actually pertains to whether or not the tab is required on the template. In the attached image to the right you can see the settings for a radio button which has required and locked under Formatting Properties, and required and locked under TemplateTag Attributes (at the bottom). The required box under formatting properties sets whether or not the radio button is required for completion, and the locked box sets whether or not the radio button can be edited (this should always be unchecked). The two boxes under Template Tag Attributes set whether the radio tab is required on the template, and whether or not it's position can be changed. I realize this doesn't pertain specifically to the API solution you are using, but my point is that you might try utilizing a radio tab in place of the checkbox tab.I hope this helps you some. I will be happy to answer any other questions you might have concerning this but hope this gets you going in the right direction as well!!;908;N/A;jblack;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

22/07/2014 14:06;;517.1;Re: Document Retention and Purging Whitepaper;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Document-Retention-and-Purging-Whitepaper/td-p/32934;"INTRODUCTION
 
Document Retention and Purging are two important topics for many customers, yet these feature areas are often poorly understood. Broadly, Document Retention settings determine the duration the documents in an envelope (*not* the Certificate of Completion) are retained and available within DocuSign storage before permanent deletion. Document Purging is the process during which documents attached to an envelope are permanently deleted.
 
In order to clarify this area of the product, the CSAs have worked with Customer Service, ProServ and Product Operations to define and validate the specifics of both Document Retention and Document Purge, with additional focus given to the details of Purge Notifications. We tested 15 unique Envelope configurations covering most basic scenarios under which a sender or recipient might receive a warning that their documents were in queue for eventual purging.
 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 
In the following pages, we have brought together knowledge from various parts of DocuSign to provide a central knowledge repository for these features. This documentation has been further supplemented by comprehensive testing around the behavior of Purge Notifications. The goal is to drive a better understanding of the Document Retention and Document Purging within the product among our staff in service to driving value for our customers.
 
  
DEFINITIONS
 
Document Retention Feature - Document Retention allows you to specify the number of days to retain documents from completed envelopes as measured from the date the envelope is Completed, Voided or Declined. Once the envelope hits its designated purge date, it is put into the purge queue. The document is then purged from the system 14 days later.
 


A warning email is sent out 14 days and 7 days prior to the purge to senders and certain types of signers. A warning will not be sent to a party who: 1) deleted the envelope from the console, or 2) does not have a DocuSign account (i.e. a signer who did not elect to activate signer account), or 3) did not previously receive a notification on the envelope (i.e. Signer 3 and the envelope was voided prior to Signer 2 signing). Once the purge happens, the envelope will still be viewable in the console, but not the document itself. Instead, a message will be displayed in place of the document stating when it was purged.
 
Document Retention (Link) - This option is used to set the number of days that documents in completed, declined and voided envelopes are retained. You are not required to set a retention date, in which case documents are retained indefinitely. When the retention date setting is reached, the envelope documents are placed in a purge queue for deletion in 14 days. A warning email notification is sent to the sender and recipients associated with the envelope notifying them that the envelope document will be deleted in 14 days and providing a link to the documents. Another email is sent 7 days later with the same message. At the end of the14-day period, the envelope documents are deleted from the system.
 




 


DISCUSSION
 
To change document retention information settings :
 
1.Click the link to go to the Document Retention Settings page
 
2.Type the number of days to retain documents from completed envelopes and click Next.
 
3.Confirm your document retention settings by typing ""I agree""
 
What Happens When an Envelope is Deleted?
 
DeleteEnvelope, whether used in the API or UI, deletes the envelope from a particular folder. Once ""deleted,"" they actually appear in the ""Deleted"" folder when accessing the Member Console, and the RecycleBin when checking via the DocuSign API.
 
An Envelope must be in a terminal state in order to be deleted. Terminal states include Completed and Voided. While the envelope is in the ""Deleted"" folder, it can be moved back to any other folder. At regular intervals, deleted Envelopes are auto-deleted from the ""Deleted"" folder and their contained documents are purged.
 
However, such deletion has one important requirement: IF and ONLY IF all references to the envelope are deleted, are the envelope documents purged. By ""references to the envelope,"" we mean any user (sender or signer) that has a folder with a copy of the envelope.
 
Also, note that since all retaining participants in this envelope have already deleted the envelope by this point, no purge warning emails are sent out. Account less Signers do not receive a warning either.
 
In turn, envelopes where documents are purged (via Retention Policy, PurgeDocuments, or through DeleteEnvelope as described above) retain envelope meta data. Only the documents are deleted.
 
DocuSign Envelopes: Expire, Purge, Delete, and Draft Explained: The lifetime and processing of envelopes and envelope docs in these states
 
Expire: Envelopes Expire day of desired expiration date, based on UTC. However, a batch job is run at 9pm PT so Expire is only based on date, not specific time stamp.
 


Purge: Envelopes go into a Purge queue day of expected Purge based on UTC. Batch job is run at 9pm PT and purge occurs based on where the envelope is in the queue. Notification emails are sent as a courtesy to both the sender and recipients. The first notification is sent on the day the envelope enters the purge queue. A second notification is sent 7 days prior to Purge. 
On the 14th day, all envelope docs are purged and no notifications are sent. We still retain all of the XML metadata and document Purge replaces the envelope documents with a placeholder document that explicitly identifies the fact that the original envelope documents have been purged.
 
The same rules apply if a Purge API call is made or Document Retention is the cause of the Purge.
Delete: When an envelope is dragged into the Deleted folder, a Delete job runs at 9pm that evening, removing the pointer of the user who deleted the envelope. If no pointers are left, the envelope docs are immediately purged (meaning the envelope no longer resides in any DocuSign user folder).
 
Drafts: Same as Deleted. Drafts are removed from the system after 30 days. The delete system only runs for so long then waits for the next day to get more. We try not to bury the system, so that is why it may take more than 30 days.
 
 
 
PURGE NOTIFICATION TESTING
 
TEST CONDITIONS
 
*Built Envelopes via Console
*Purged via SOAP API ""PurgeDocuments "" (functionality is not available in REST)
*Purged during daytime, EST
*All Accounts used in DEMO
*Manage Email Notifications: Notify me when: I am
a signer ""Documents inside an envelope will be purged from the system"" - Checked 





*Document Retention set to ""null"" (Indefinite retention)
*Purge Warning Emails are supposed to be sent at 14 days, and then 7 days before the document is purged. We have so far only tested for the 14 day warning.
 
FINDINGS
 
* About Purging in General
  o Running PurgeDocuments on an envelope immediately marks it as ""requested to be purged.""
  o Purge Warning Emails though, are sent out via something similar to a batch job that runs at 9PM PST/12AM EST.
 
* About the Receipt of 14-Day Purge Warning Emails
  o Account/Membership Holders receive Purge warnings when a:
    *Sender
    *Signer
    *""Acknowledge Receipt"" Recipient
    *""Receive a Copy"" Recipient
    *In-Person Signing Host
  o In-Person Signers do not receive purge warnings even if they supply their email at the end the signing ceremony and even if they have a pre-existing account/ membership at the email address supplied. There's still a little testing around this to see if perhaps matching up the signer name and email exactly with a pre-existing account can get purge warnings to show up.
 


  o Accountless Signers do not receive purge warnings in any of the tested scenarios.
    *Not as Signers
    *Not as ""Acknowledge Receipt"" Recipients
    *Not as ""Receive a Copy"" Recipients
    *Not as In Person Signers

Good Question, Yes you can with Embedded Signing. 
With Embedded Signing you can generate a user-authenticated URL that, when navigated to, begins the signing workflow of a given envelope. This means that you do not have to wait for any emails to arrive to sign documents. Embedded Signing is very popular with website developers, since it allows your users to use DocuSign functionality without having to leave your website.

One is for registration agreement. If I use an iFrame for the PowerForm, how will I know the signature was a success and if it wasn't a success what the error was? I know I can set landing pages, but those are general landing pages and not landing pages related to a specific PowerForm. I can't allow users to certain information until they sign certain forms without any errors and if there are errors, I need to programmatically help them through the process.

Now when we select the custom button we don't get an error but nothing is happening. I simply need the custom button to act exactly the same as the ""Sign with docusign"" button does on all the standard object pages. I am not a developer therefore do not really know where to begin editing the code and the documentation about all the parameters really doesn't help me.

This would alleviate a step where we would have to be told they would like to request equipment, then send an envelope with the required forms in it, to have them filled out and sent back.

I have merged your question with a related thread above. 
 
You are interested in our Powerforms Feature. Learn more with our Video Tip Powerform Setup
 
With Embedded Signing you can generate a user-authenticated URL that, when navigated to, begins the signing workflow of a given envelope. This means that you do not have to wait for any emails to arrive to sign documents. Embedded Signing is very popular with website developers, since it allows your users to use DocuSign functionality without having to leave your website.

As per default during the signing process it will automatically navigate the required fields that the signer is supposed to sign.

In order to get your scenario working you will need to follow this process:
 
Send your Envelope as normal, on the landing page after sending, place a link to ""correct.php"" (your language of choice). 
Correct.php will use the API method CorrectAndResendEnvelope to change the Recipient into a Captive Recipient. 
After changing the Recipient, you'll use RequestRecipientToken to get the URL for the signing  process. 
 
Long story short, you will not be able to get the actual URL that is sent to the Recipient through email, but you can use this workaround to mimic that functionality.";991;N/A;nicholasareed;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

You are resending correctly through the DocuSign Console.  If the other sales reps are also DocuSign for Salesforce Users you can set up Sharing and they would then have access to act on envelopes that they were not the original Sender.  To enable Sharing for Users from the DocuSign Console > Preferences > Users > Select a User that someone would need access to > Open > Sharing Tab > Check the users who will be able to see and act on this user's folders.

Using offline signing does have the same level of security as signing while online.  Offline signing will not go into any status change or submission until the user who is signing gets connection back on their device.  This feature allows them to open the document and sign it without connection to the internet.  All of the information will upload to DocuSign when they regain conenction,
 
When processing, the events in envelope audit trail are marked with the description ""Offline"" as appropriate. The Certificate of Completion will include a separate Offline section that will have the offline signing view event and complete event date/time information, the recipient photo (if included), and any custom information (such as the offlineAttributes) for the signer.
 
Offline Signing Settings and Restrictions
The following settings and restrictions apply to offline signing use cases.

Offline signing is not allowed when sending from templates.
All offline signers must be in routing order 1 and must have at least one required signature or initials tag. Other recipients can be included in the envelope.
Offline signing supports the following tab types:

Sign Here, Initial Here, Date Signed, Full Name, Company, Title, Text and Checkbox

When sending an offline signing envelope, the envelope ""status"" must be set to ""sent"" (""status""=""created"" is not allowed and will cause an error).
When sending an offline signing envelope, the following Signers Recipient type settings are required: clientUserId, deliveryMethod (must be set to ""offline"") and signedDateTime. An image of the signer's signature/initials must be included for each signature or initials tab. The image is included as part of the multipart section. Optionally, you can include a deliveredDateTime parameter, but if this parameter is not included DocuSign will set it to the signedDateTime value.

04/06/2015 06:23;;556.6;iOS offline app;http://community.docusign.com/t5/Misc-Dev-Archive-READ-ONLY/Offline-mode-amp-Digital-signature/td-p/30840;"Hi, We are trying to work out if what we have been asked to provide to a customer is possible so have not yet begun using DocuSign. Our requirement is to produce an iPad app.  Part of it involves a contract (pdf) more like an invoice (list of parts, prices etc) with contract terms on it and show this to the customer and have them sign it.   It is important that this would work in an offline environment (no 3G signal in some buildings etc).  The salesman would visit the customer with an iPad running our app, discuss requirements with the customer, set up an order and get the customer to sign there and then.  Our app would use cached data for parts, pricing etc, obtained the last time the device was online. There is one post similar to this on the lists from 2012 and is closed and answered as ""not currently possible"" but that was a long time ago (in software terms). I see the DocuSign app has offline capability so to keep our app simple, if possible we could push the file to the app and have that handle the signing and sending etc on our behalf (we don't have any specific need for the signing to take place inside our app and would welcome this being simple and robust due to that side being in an official app dedicated to signing). If it is to be in our app, is this possible, what would be the basic flow?  Say the contract has to have name, address, list of parts with quantities and prices, a total and then be signed.  Would this be possible with templates?  (I have seen that offline signing with templates is not possible?) or would we need to generate a pdf file in code on the iPad then get that shown & signed using the mobile sdk for Objective C? (is this even possible!). I'm sorry this is so vague.  It is early days for us and I have been reading documentation for a couple of hours now and can't see anything that fits our use case but it seems likes something many people would want to be able to do so hopefully there's a recommended way to achieve it? Thanks in advance for any advice.";363;N/A;crothery;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I am glad that you are exploring DocuSign for your customers app. I can you point you towards some resources that should help clear some things up. 
 

Offline Signing Dev Overview
Offline access with the DocuSign Mobile App for iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch)

 
If you are utilizing our the DocuSign App, Only photos and documents stored locally in the device Library are available for offline access. This may be the easiest iIf your customer can manually tag the document and this is compatible with your workflow
 
Integrating DocuSign into your app will require an integration with our API. This is an advanced topic for this community and you will have better luck on our Dev Community. 
 
Learn more in the related thread How does actual ""signing"" happen ""offline"" via API?

I had found some of that information already but it's good to know I was looking in the right place. On the stack overflow link you posted, mikebz says: ""Hey! No problem at all. The instructions on how to use offline signing or how it works won't be on StackOverflow until the protocol is deemed suitable to be public. Hope that makes sense. "" Does this mean that the documentation for how to do this isn't publicly available but is made available on a case by case basis to people/companies who have been through process of getting the more powerful integrator key that allows offline scanning? As per the posters reply on that stack overflow query, the documentation describes how to do it in a high level way but the actual detail is lacking so it's hard to gauge how much work is involved to add offline signing to an app. Ultimately the answer is going to be to start working with it and get a feel for it but at this stage we don't have an R&D budget to give to it so I'm doing the feasibility study in order to get a couple of days to play.";346;N/A;crothery;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

First off, ""Sign in Person"" is the ability to sign face-to-face with someone. This utilizes an iPad or smart phone for two people to sign together face-to-face, but this is still an electronic process. For more info on how that works, click here. Since ""Sign in Person"" is something different than wet signing,  the signing action should be set to ""Sign."" Your admin should be able to disable the ""Sign in Person"" options through the admin settings, if you want to disable this feature for your users. This brings me to your main issue. Based on the terminology you've used, (""developer"" and ""enable Wet Sign is set to true""), it sounds like you might be using an API. Is that the case? If you are not using API, then the Sign on Paper option is called ""Sign on Paper"" under preferences in the admin's account. If you are using an API, more information is needed to figure out why wet signing isn't working, like screen shots or perhaps calling support. In addition, the wet sign options appears on a pop up before viewing the envelope. It should look something like this:I just want to make sure that the developer was looking in the right place to find the ""Sign on Paper"" option.  I hope this was helpful enough to at least get you heading in the right direction! -olivilot";386;N/A;olivilot;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

This API call returns two DateTime values of interest:  deliveredDateTime and signedDateTime.  I am able to call and use this API successfully.  However, it appears to me that deliveredDateTime is not specified until the user actually clicks the email link AND clicks the review documents button on the signer view.  Since what I was actually interested in might be better described as sentDateTime, deliveredDateTime doesn't appear to work for my needs.This API call returns a detailed list of all events that have transpired on the envelope, including individual receipient status updates.  However, the data format is such that in order to tie the result data back to recipients, I have to do string matches on the recipient name.  I'd prefer to do the match based on email or, better still, recipientID, but the audit log entries for ""sent invitations"" and ""signed"" don't contain these fields.

I have utilized the bulk recipient feature, which allows me to send multiple contracts within an envelope at a time, however I can't find a good way to identify each of the documents within the envelope. What I need is similar to the Envelope Custom Field that would add an identifier to my envelope, but I need that identifier to be unique for each of the contracts I am sending out within the envelope. Ideally, this would be a field that I could add to my bulk recipient .csv file, that then becomes associated with the envelope, so that when I pull up the information in the Manage tab or export the envelope data, I can use that field as a look-up. The end result needs to be the ability to look-up and track each document with a unique identifier that I provide. So far I have not found something that can help me do this - am I missing something?;469;3;BR;0;question;;;;;;

You may be interested in Retrieve. You could create  DocuSign Tag Name column in the CSV file and have Fetch pull the Tag info so that you can look-up the individual envelopes. 
 
 
**Fetch is a DocuSign product that allows you to download envelope information from DocuSign by creating Fetch settings. Fetch settings are ""bookmarks"" where you save search information. When creating Fetch settings, you can select the date range and the envelope statuses to search, along with how and where to save the search results. A Fetch setting can be saved for later use and used to build a command line for schedule tasks with the built-in Fetch Console Script Builder. The DocuSign Fetch application and Fetch settings can be set up with the assistance of DocuSign Professional Services. Contact your Account Manager for more information about working with DocuSign Professional Services and Fetch.

From reading the document you linked, it sounds like this is a way to export any tagged fields I have added to my documents, right?

So for example, if I added FieldA FieldB and FieldC using a Bulk Recipient .csv file to 10 envelopes, and each envelope contained 50 documents, I could use Fetch to pull back any or all of my tagged fields for all 500 documents?

Just keep in mind that we have an API limit of 1000 calls per hour. You will have to schedule out the fetch reports depending on the volume.

This is why you need to use SOQL Builder to grab the Owner of the DocuSign Envelope Record based off of the 32 Digit dsfs__DocuSign_Envelope_ID__c.  Your query to find the associated Envelope record from the DocuSign Status Record's dsfs__DocuSign_Envelope_ID__c will look something like this:SELECT Id, OwnerId, dsfs__DocuSign_Envelope_ID__cFROM dsfs__DocuSign_Envelope__cWHERE dsfs__DocuSign_Envelope_ID__c = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' One you have your list, you'll then need to loop through to grab the owner.  The trigger is only a few lines of code and the SOQL call shouldn't take too much time.  If you're new to Apex or coding in general, it will take some time. There is a caveat with this..  The Owner is updated to the DocuSign System Sender everytime the system posts back the DocuSign Status Record.  You'll want to run your trigger when the record is complete.

This is a great solution and thank you for sharing.
 
As a best practice, I would like to share with everyone that we would not recommend writing code or triggers that reference custom fields from DocuSign's managed package.
 
Reason being, if DocuSign changed the API names of the fields from an update, your trigger would no longer work.
 
To counter this, I would then recommend creating your own custom object with the same type of fields and have Connect publish to this new object. This way, you have control over these fields within the Salesforce org and not dependant from the managed package.

The DocuSign Send On Behalf Of functionality permits automated sending through the DocuSign API by an integrated sender on behalf of another sender.
The Send On Behalf Of functionality is only available to Enterprise level accounts that use the DocuSign API to send envelopes. 
This guide provides information about how the functionality works, how to enable the function, and how to use the function in the API sending process.
 
Our Dev Center also has the SOBO Guide

I seemed to recall there was a checkbox under Preferences --> Features which allowed.  Now I only see an option 'Attach Certificate of Completion to the EnvelopePDF' which appears to only append the CoC if the user manually downloads the file from DocuSign.  Instead, I would like to have the CoC append such that a concatenated fille (document + certificate of completion) will be passed back to Ariba for long-term storage.  Additionally--since we have enabled the document to attach to the Completion email--we would prefer that the Certificate and signed document attach to the email as one concatenated file.;835;3;uddinmd;0;question;API. append.

You can complete the first step by embedding a powerform into your Web page. 
You can view our popular Video Tip: Powerform Setup to learn the basics. 
Be sure to view the Supporting Guide Embedding a DocuSign PowerForm in a web page.
 
You will need to customize the appearance of the ""Go to Next Video"" button.

However, you can direct the signer to a customized landing page. 
 
Default API landing pages for Web PowerForms
 
 
After a signer takes an action with a PowerForm, such as completing the PowerForm or declining to sign, they are taken to a landing page.
 
If your account has not defined landing pages for the signer events, the DocuSign system provides a set of default landing pages for PowerForms. You can change these landing pages from the DocuSign console by going to your Preferences, clicking Features under the Account Administration section and clicking the In-session Landing pages link under Advanced Options. The link takes you to the Embedded Signing Landing Pages page, where you can change the URLs for your custom landing pages.
 
The events and default landing page URLs are shown below.

OnSigningComplete: .../PowerForms/LandingPages/SigningComplete.htm
OnViewComplete: .../PowerForms/LandingPages/ViewingComplete.htm
OnCancel: .../PowerForms/LandingPages/Cancelled.htm
OnDecline: .../PowerForms/LandingPages/Declined.htm
OnSessionTimeOut: .../PowerForms/LandingPages/WebSessionTimeOut.htm
OnTTLExpired (Token Expried): .../PowerForms/LandingPages/TokenExpired.htm

Close deals faster with DocuSign for NetSuite. The DocuSign for NetSuite connector is the easiest way for users of NetSuite close more deals by collecting, tracking, and storing signatures from customers within minutes.
Sending a contract or any other type of document for electronic signature is simple using the DocuSign for NetSuite connector.

You can enable an authoritative copy to be made through REST api by settingauthoritativeCopy property to true on a given envelope. Retrieving the copy is only possible through SOAP at the moment. 
 
The SOAP API guide has a few pages that describe how to get the Authoritative Copy. Basically, it's not just one API call but several that you need to make. I'm not sure what's causing the error you've listed above, not enough info to debug, but the following should help you get this working.
The basic idea is that you need to extract the envelope first, then you obtain a key that allows you to decrypt the docs. I believe when you obtain the key is when the envelope is deleted from the source location, so that you now have the one and only authoritative copy.
 
The following pages explain the calls in detail:
ExportAuthoritativeCopy
AuthoritativeCopyExportDocuments
AcknowledgeAuthoritativeCopyExport
AuthoritativeCopyExportStatus
 
Also, the following page has some important rules related to Authoritative copy that you should know about

Your error indicates that you are entering text in a data field that is only meant for numbers. 
 
I think you have a zipcode data field that has a number mask.
Can you try resolving the error by removing the (zip code) text from the initial value of the data field. 
1. Select zipcode data fields and click the gear icon 
2. Replace the initial value (zip code) with a number ex: 12345
3. You may have to repeat, depending on the number of data fields with masks. 
 
You should now be able to send the envelope

Introducing the DocuSign  API
 

With our open REST API you could be requesting signatures and signing documents through your app or website within minutes. The following sections show you just how easy it is to go from no code to signing anything, anywhere, on any device.
 
Here are some tools to get you started. 
 


YOUR FIRST API CALL
A guide to making your first API call.


 
REQUEST A SIGNATURE
Send a signature request through the API.


 
API TOOLS
Some great tools to help you get going fast.
 
 
Ready to start exploring the most feature rich eSignature API in the world?
 
The following sections explain what's possible with the DocuSign REST API and introduce some important features such as Templates, Embedding, and Stick-eTabs. It also introduces DocuSign Connect, which is used to send real-time updates to external applications and for reporting.
 
With the DocuSign API you can...

Request legally binding signatures on any type of document
Initiate signing sessions
Track documents in real-time
Retrieve signed documents
Embed DocuSign into websites and apps

Note: When requesting signatures or signing documents you can initiate your requests through email links or through URL tokens. Most examples you'll see listed on this site use the email method of delivery. For more information on using URL tokens please see the Embedding DocuSign section.

We sent out an envelope to a particular recipient for signature, but it was signed by a completely different person!  For example, the document was sent to John Smith at thebighouse@mymail.com  as recipient 1.  The document was completed, but upon examination, the signature says Jayne Doe.  In our configuration I have a setting checked that says 'Lock the recipient name' and feel that the sender should be in control of the envelope.  If we pass a name, that is the name we expect to show in the document.  If that is not the correct name, I expect the signer to contact our company or decline to sign.  If we are selling a policy to a specific insured, or if someone is signing as an excluded driver,  that is the only person who can sign the contract. Per DocuSign, based solely on the email address, they saw there was already a DocuSign account using that email address and used the name associated with the DocuSign account as the signer instead of the name we passed in the request. DocuSign should have noted that there was not an email/name combo match with an existing account and treated it like any other non-account signing.;636;3;klang;0;question;;;;;;

Can you clarify what you mean by ""pass a name"" ? Are you using our API?
If you are using a custom integration, we would really need to investigate your account, workflow and the recipient account. 
 
Due to the more advanced nature of your issue, I don't recommend troubleshooting over the community, as we may need to reproduce over the phone and conduct a screen share. Please Contact Us and we would be happy to investigate further  to verify if this is indeed a bug, user error, or clarify why it is by design.

Envelope is sent with one remote signer and one embedded signer
Remote signer signs first
Embedded signer signs after remote signer

 
Or are 2 and 3 switched?
 
If the remote signer is first, then you will need some way to indicate that your captive signer can start signing. This may be a button that becomes active once the first recipient has signed.
 
If the remote signer is second, then they will receive an email as soon as the envelope is in a state where they can sign it (the captive signer has signed).

A DocuSign account that allows for API integration in production requires an enterprise account. Once you are ready to discuss pricing, you can request a quote that will suit your needs.
 
For the API, certain calls do not cost more or less than others. We do have API rate limits that restrict you to 1000 calls per hour. We also have guidelines that require you to not poll for status of your envelopes more than once every 15 minutes.

Only the third signer is actually putting a SIGNATURE on the document, the other two are just getting it set up for them. We are using embedded signing. The form has a bunch of fields, most of which are set to editable by all, that are owned by the first signer (Submitter) and the only actual ""signature"" field on the form is owned by the third signer (Approver). The second signer (Processor) does not own any fields and can only edit the ""editable by all"" fields. We create the envelope via the API. Submitter is redirected to a signing session and fills out the form, then clicks to submit. The Processor then opens the form, makes corrections, and submits. They then signal the Approver to look at it. The Approver looks at it, if they sign it here (keep in mind they are the only person who Legal considers to be ""signing"" anything) then this is simple, it works fine. However, sometimes they want something changed - and aren't going to change it themselves - so they kick it back to the Processor. The Processor now needs to be able to open and edit/sign the form again. I can do this from the web interface with Advanced Correct, but can't find a way to do this from the API.

The first is the advance correct functionality. You can enable this with the RequestCorrectToken method, which allows you to use that advance correct feature of the web console in your application.
 
However, you may want to explore the AllowMarkup feature as a lightweight way to accomplish your desired functionality. This allows that sort of collaboration, but requires all other recipients to initial and approve the changes. You can read about the markup functionality in this blog entry. Enabling the markup feature is easy to do when creating the envelope, and does not require any additional method calls during the envelope signing process (whereas the advance correct functionality would).

Now my question lies in writing the test classes for the respective Apex controllers used in this example. As you know in salesforce, i cannot be able to deploy any Apex Controller from sandbox to production environment without test cases with 75% code coverage. So far in all your salesforce examples, i have not come across any test cases fo9r the contollers which are very crucial to allow deployment from the salesforce sandbox environment to Production environment.Therefore am now stranded with a working solution on my salesforce sandbox which i cannot have it implemented on the production environment due to failure in deployement.;461;N/A;maggysweety;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

I suspect that in the original envelope creation call (CreateEnvelope...) you are assigning a routing order to the recipients.  When you call RequestRecipientToken you need to make sure that you let the recipient with a lower routing order complete all the actions before you go ahead and call for a token for the next one.

(1)
You can bypass the first screen by passing in the name and e-mail of the signer on the URL string.  See advanced topics starting on page 10.  http://www.docusign.com/images/resources/membernet_doc/powerforms%20user%20guide%2010.2.pdf
 
Example: Signer_Email=John.Smith@yahoo.com
 
You can also pass field information in:
Example: EnvelopeField_Region=Northwest
 
(2)
By the access code do you mean the access code specified for the template or some other one?
 
(3)
Disclosure can be disabled for your account.  I do want to say that disclosure is a legal requirement when dealing with consumers.  While it is a distraction it will help you be compliant with the ESIGN legislature unless you are doing B2B stuff only.  (BTW, I am not an attorney so please consult your own before you take my opinions as the law).
 
(4)
Prompt for signature selection can be eliminated but you will need to use our SOAP API for that.  Powerforms do not hae the switches to do that.

<DataValue>
<TabLabel>Membership Type</TabLabel>
<Value>Platinum</Value>
</DataValue>
Where you are selecting the platinum option of the radio buttons. Radio buttons are a little unique in that every one in the same group has the same tablabel. Therefore, you have to use their name to reference them.
 
If I read your template correctly, you have already selected the Platinum option, therefore you do not need to select it again via the API.
 
Likewise, if you are not pushing information into a tab, there is no need to create a TemplateReferenceFieldDataDataValue for it (I see that you are sending nothing across for fields such as Spouse Name -- you can just omit those).
 
I have to do a little bit more digging into how to use the field data value to select a radio button via the API -- when creating envelopes from scratch it is simple, but the referencing the field takes a different approach.
 
Either way, this error message could probably be improved. I'll see what we can do on that end.

here is the update.
 

The TabStatus.DocumentID elements are not present in the RequestStatusEx response for envelope f63b7b32-cca7-4435-..... (the envelope referenced in the soap request), because there is no ExternalId for the document associated with the envelope (the ExternalId is what is shown as DocumentID)! This indicates this envelope (and the template it was created from) were created via the UI, not the API. 
 
The documents provided in envelopes created via the API, have DocumentIDs provided by the submitter (for cross-referencing purposes). We refer to these as the documents' external IDs. It is the external DocumentIDs that RequestStatusEx returns as TabStatus.DocumentID. Envelopes created via the UI do not have external DocumentIDs. This is why TabStatus.DocumentID elements are not returned by RequestStatusEx when the requested envelope was created via the UI.

 
 I followed up with a question of whether or not you can do anythign else to identify your tabs or documents when they were sent from GUI and this is what I've got:
 

For envelopes not created via the API, the sender will have to rely on TabLabels and TabNames (and possibly PageNumber) to identify tabs. TabStatus.DocumentID won't be present in the envelope status.";932;N/A;mikebz;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

If I set up an envelope with one document and one signer, and create tabs in code with anchor text ""{s_1}"", I get a signature tab for each instance of the text, and everything works fine.  I can test by sending the document to myself and signing each tab as normal. If I, however, have two documents in the envelope, and use the same anchor text across the two documents, I get all the tabs and everything looks fine.  I can click each tab to sign, and my signature appears as normal.  However, when I get to the last tab,  it doesn't give me the confirm message; instead, it just cycles me back to the starting tab as if I hadn't signed anything.  My signature is there, but it inists that I did not sign the tab.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to break out of this cycle: no matter how many times I click through all the tabs, it keeps cycling through them again. I submitted a question to the signing help email, and they suggested that there are multiple tabs in each location, but this does not appear to be the case - each anchor string appears only once at each location, and there is one corresponding tab for each.  The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that the anchor text appears in more than one document. Any ideas?  Thanks.  Here's the code used to create the tabs: Tab tab = new Tab();                tab.DocumentID = dsDoc.ID;      // Different for each documenttab.RecipientID = dsRecipient.ID;  // The same for both documentstab.Type = TabTypeCode.SignHere;                tab.AnchorTabItem = new AnchorTab();                tab.AnchorTabItem.AnchorTabString = ""{s_1}"";                tab.AnchorTabItem.Unit = UnitTypeCode.Pixels;                tab.AnchorTabItem.UnitSpecified = true;                tab.AnchorTabItem.XOffset = 1;                tab.AnchorTabItem.YOffset = 10;                                tab.AnchorTabItem.IgnoreIfNotPresent = true;                tab.AnchorTabItem.IgnoreIfNotPresentSpecified = true;     Thanks!";535;3;gordonmgreen;0;question;;;;;;

I would recommend setting the EnforceSignerVisibility value if you are using the Document Visibility function in order to have the most predictable behavior.  In the case that all of your Envelopes uniformly use the same policy, this could merely be a hard-coded value, so it's little effort to pass.  And if you actually need to support diffierent Visibility behaviors for different Envelopes, then you'll need to interact with this property anyways, so it's best to set the value explicitly instead of delegating the behavior a default value for the property. In the case that you are not using the Document Visibility functionality, there's no need to set a property value.;391;N/A;oldschool;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

With LoanCo you are using something we call ""Embedded"" workflow.  In the embedded workflow your application specifies a ClientUserId field and takes on the responsibility of presenting the signing experience to the signer.
 
Here is the diagram of the embedded flow interaction: http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/DocuSignService%20API%20Overview/Usage%20Diagram.htm
 
You can have multiple signers with an embedded pattern, you will just need to call RequestRecipientToken for every one of those.
 
If you want our system to send out e-mail and invite signers to sign through our web application directly you should remove the ClientUserId.  You also will not need to call RequestRecipientToken.

Are you looking to automate signing so the ""Read and Approved"" is applied programmatically instead of by a human?
 
If you are not looking to do that - read on:
 
You can construct the ""Read and Approved"" signature block and place our signatures right in it.  Once people adopt their electronic signature which they only do once - they will be able to sign that block with just two clicks (for two signatures).
 
This would still save a lot of time and paper while being in complete compliance and having an audit trail that shows that a human actually took a look at the document.";1214;N/A;mikebz;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

When the envelope is created and opened at the DocuSign site, the value is set correctly.  However, when the existing template is applied to the newly created DocuSign envelope, it's getting override with the value that seems to be in the template. Is there a way to stop this?If the envelope is created with ExpireAfter value = 7, we want to the envelope to expire 7 days after even if the template that is applied later has the ExpireAfter value = 120.;479;1;jonasworld;0;question;;;;;;

Create the envelope in code
Call CreateEnvelope using the API
Go to your draft and apply/match with template

If that's not correct, feel free to let me know!
 
 
So, my answer will pertain to that scenario. What you are seeing is the correct behavior. If you apply a template after creating the envelope, then the expiration setting will get overwritten.
 
However, if you create an envelope using the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplates method, it will respect the setting that you specify in the envelope information. This allows you to use a template that exists on your account without having to go and apply it.
 
The issue that you are seeing has to do with what data should win out: should it be the data that you specified when creating the envelope, or the data in the template? In this case, it is whichever is applied last. As the last thing that you specify is the template, which has the 120 day setting, that is the setting that wins. When you use the template when creating the envelope, then you are using the template to create the envelope, and the information you specify goes on top of it -- thus, that information wins.
 
Make sense? Please let me know if you have any more questions or want more clarification!";403;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;0;answer;N/A;;;;;

It is still considered a best practice, however!
 
That error generally occurs when you request the token for a recipient that cannot yet sign due to routing order restrictions. Make sure that you are requesting the token for the user who is next in line to sign!
 
If this is not the case, can you talk about how you are creating and sending the envelope? If you could post the SOAP request for the envelope creation and the RequestRecipientToken call as well, we can figure out what's going on a bit better.

A way to accomplish what you want is to create a template from a pdf as a draft (making sure ActivateEnvelope is false) then use CreateEnvelopeFromTemplate to add more tabs to them that you know should be there. Creating your Email tab as an Anchor Tag can help you place the tab with having to know it's X Y location.";1018;N/A;craigatdocusign;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

Then click button ""next"" and go to another page on which there is a tag editor and the reservationlist can use the editor to specify tags for each selected person. Once this is done, the reservationlist click button ""Send"" and the envelop is  sent to docusign system.  All above should be finished in our system.

Integrating with the API gives you the ability to embed the DocuSign sending experience right inside your own site/application. This is what we call ""embedded sending."" This allows your users to be dropped into the DocuSign console with an envelope that has already been created with as little or as much information as you want.
 
In your case, you could create the DocuSign envelope with the document and recipients and then go into the DocuSign embedded signing experience in order to let your user specify the tabs that he or she wants to add to the envelope. This sending experience is embedded using an iframe in your own application. From this experience, your user can send the envelope out for signature.
 
A bit about the technical details that make this happen:
 
 

Your envelope must be in a draft state in order to be able to use this functionality. This means using a method that doesn't send it right away, like CreateEnvelope.
Then, you request a URL from DocuSign that points to the embedded sending experience. You would set the src of your iframe to that URL and your user would see what you call the tag editor inside your page. To get this URL, you would use the method RequestSenderToken.

To see an example of the functionality that I've described, as well as to see the code that makes it happen, take a look at the LoanCo project in our github code repository. When you run it, you want to make sure to check the box labeled ""Customize Insurance Application? (Embedded Sending)"" to see the pertinent example.
To conclude, you can get the full power of the DocuSign sending user interface within your application by utilizing the steps outlined above. Your users never have to leave your system!";681;N/A;juliaAtDocuSign;1;answer;N/A;;;;;

When PowerForms are enabled for your account you can create a PowerForm from an existing DocuSign template. Each Powerform generates a link that automatically creates a DocuSign Envelope, from a Template. You can also embed this Powerfrom link in a Web Page and create custom fields. With custom programming, you can populate custom envelope fields in a WebForm, embed a Powerforms in a web page, and add infromation to a Powerform through JavaScript.
 
To learn how, please view the Advanced Topics in our DocuSign Powerform User Guide.

Unfortunately, there are too many external variables and I would need more information to troubleshoot the problem.
Are you the admin on the MS Dynamic Account?  If not, the The MS Dynamics CRM API will not work with Trial Accounts. You should be using the email for the paid account and have the features that you noted, enabled. 
 
**PLease do not post any account sensitive information. If necessary, please private message me your account ID and email on the paid Docusign Account. You can do this by clicking on my Username and selecting the ""Send this user a private message"" in the Contact Box on the right.
