You can use the normal Stick-eTabs available on the left hand side of the tagging screen to populate the Name, Address, Zip, etc. fields.  
 
What does your template look like (i.e. the one with ID 69A12386-38F0-4107-B00E-92AF6CAF858C)??  All you have to do is add the Name, Address, etc. fields to your template role, make sure it's called ""Role"" since that's what you are passing in your body, and the fields should show up for that role.  Your body should look similar to this:
 
{
    ""accountId"": ""283064"",
    ""emailSubject"": ""Test Subject"",
    ""emailBlurb"": ""This comes from PHP"",
    ""templateId"": ""69A12386-38F0-4107-B00E-92AF6CAF858C"",

        }
    ],
    ""status"": ""sent""
}
 
 You'll probably have to add textTabs for the non-standard fields.  But still, you only add these to the template through the web UI, and then reference the template like above.  You shouldn't have any tabs in your request body, they are contained in the template already...";1035;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

When we test this by adding data fields in the template, rename the label and save as 'custom', they don't show up on the document for review.

This should be easy to do, but I feel that I should explain some fundamentals first about tagging documents.  The most important thing to remember is that Stick-eTabs (aka tabs or tags) are not specific to a do...... instead they are specific for a recipient, or a template role if using templates.  You can't have a generic document tab that everyone signs.  
 
Having said that, there are two things that I'd like to clarify.  First off, when you do ""Save As Custom"" on the data field that you just added, all that does is save that Stick-eTab and its settings into your account for future use.  You'll see on the left side of the tagging screen that you have Standard tabs and you have Custom tabs, all those tabs you saved as custom should on that list and can easily be added to any of your envelopes now.  
 
Next, how many template roles do you have in your template, more than one?  I'm wondering if you are adding the tabs for a different template role and that's why they are not showing up for the other recipients?";989;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Look at the request body you are building, there's only 1 template referenced (only one templateId) where in that one and only template you are populating the values of 4 textTabs.
 
Has your developer read through the Developer Center website and API documentation?  I think what you want is to use compositeTemplates, you can read more about them here:
http://www.docusign.com/developer-center/explore/features/templates
 
Also, the example 3 of the webinar uses compositeTemplates.

These forums are for general api questions and knowledge sharing and they are completely free, any support payments you may be making are for our professional services team and or solution engineers and general support.  
 
In any case, I still had a look at your latest attachments and tested out myself.  I was able to get this to work to just fine using the exact request body that you've provided.  All I did was change the templateIds and email address and it worked with my two templates.
 
I suggest making everything from scrath and creating new templates and testing out instead of trying to force what you've got already.  I just went through this whole process in less than 10 minutes so it's very quick:
 
1.  Create a new template, give it one role named ""Patient"", and add a document to the template.
2.  Add two data fields and one signature tab to the template.  Give one of the data fields a tab label of ""first_name"" and the other ""last_name""
3.  Save the template.
4.  Create another template, give it a different document, and use the same values for the role and tab labels (i.e. Patient and first_name, last_name)
5.  Save 2nd template.
6.  Copy template IDs into your JSON request body.
7.  Send the signature request.
 
As mentioned, this worked for me.  Let us know your results...";976;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Maybe you can tell me what is going wrong.  The premise is that we've used your example on how to do two mock templates (which we did).  As a emailed role, I received them and was able to see that both templates came across in one envelope.  I was also able to add my first name/last name and signature to it.  After doing so, I was able to review the documents with my information on there. Here is what I am thinking may be the problem.  We have developed a website that we have which has fields to be completed, as well as checkbox's which are tied into the template ids.  We want particular fields (e.g. first_name, last_name, address, etc..) to pass automatically in the various spots of the templates that it is calling. This example, my developer says, isn't passing any of the field information that way.  Although, I was able to see and add my user information using your example.;966;N/A;darriankendall1;0;answer;N/A

When you say your users are filling out a form, is this a form on a website?  And once they are done filling out the form you want a signature request sent to the person who filled out the form, correct?  If so then yes, this is possible and easy with DocuSign.
 
We encourage the REST API over SOAP but it's your choice which protocol you'd like to use.  To begin simply create a free developer account through the Developer Center, genereate your Integrator Key, then you can start sending signature requests through the API.  
 
Three great tools at your disposal are:
 
API Explorer - Allows you to make sample API calls without writing any code, and you can see the request and response bodies and headers.
 
API Walkthroughs - 9 common use cases of the DocuSign API each written in 5 different languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python).  You can copy the code into your IDE, change the credentials at the top, build and run.
 
REST API Guide - Lots of valuable information available in online, searchable format.  You can also download it from the Dev Center.

That's not what you need.
 
To generate your integrator key simply login to your demo account then click your profile icon in the top right and go to Preferences -> API.  The link for API will be in the bottom left of the next sceen so you'll have to scroll down for it.
 
Once on the following screen enter a description then click the ""Get Demo Integrator Key"" and you'll get your key immediately through the page.

We have several important tools to help you integrate with our API.  Do you know which protocol you'd like to use, REST or SOAP?  We encourage REST and have more tools for it, but the choice is yours.
 
Our APIs have the ability to easily embed sending and signing functionality into your website.  Generally speaking, there are two ways of initiating requests- remote or embedded.  With remote your recipients receive an email to start the signing process.  With embedded you can generate authenticated URLs that your users navigate to in order to start the signing process- This is what you want- Embedded functionality for your website.
 
The documentation is a good place to start:  REST API Documentation  or  SOAP API Documentation
 
And for the REST API we have two great tools:
 
The API Explorer (base off of ioDocs technology) allows you to make test API calls in REST without writing a single line of code.
The API Walkthroughs show you 9 common scenarios of the API, each written in 5 different languages (PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python).  If you look at the last three walkthroughs 7, 8, and 9, they all cover Embedded functionality:

You can try out to see what happens when an account member sends an envelope by sending through the DocuSign Console.
 
So, you have two options: 
 
1) once you create the member, you need to do the Login...etc; using that member's credentials

If this is what you want, let me know and I can go ahead and do that for you. However, you cannot remove the sign later functionality, as we need to provide a way for users to leave and come back. For embedded signing, this means that you should handle it through the OnCancel URL.
 
Especially since the token you receive for embedded signing is a one time use URL with a five-minute timeout, it may be that both cancel and timeout allow you to get a new token to come back into the signing experience.

Can this be achieved and if so what is the best method ?

Can you please elaborate on the whole process here?
 
At a very high level, you can include mutliple documents, recipients, and signature and information tabs in a single envelope.  And of course you can have multiple people send envelopes to a single email address.  I just need to understand your goals more to be able to provide a clearer answer for you...

We have a single registration page, which is typically a 1-to-1 registration; that is:         1 member -> 1 registration -> 1 document to sign   we are now looking at enhancing this so the registration can encompass a many-to-1 registration; that is  :         1-to-many members -> 1 registration -> 1-to-many documents to sign (1 p/member) the later would require each member for that registration to complete and sign separate (or individual) documents as though they registered individually.

Yes this is definitely possible using the DocuSign REST API.  (In general we encourage use of the REST API but you can also use our SOAP API if you prefer that protocol.)
 
I think all you need to do is grab the information of each registering member and you can then send an envelope per user (or have more than one user in an envelope but it sounds like you want a 1-to-1 correlation).  So for instance, if your page has a section where multiple users can enter their contact info (i.e. Full Name and email address for each user) then you can easily send signature requests to each of those users and have them sign separately (individually) from everyone else.  
 
For instance, if you're member data is something like:
 
John Doe john@email.com
Bob Smith bob@email.com
Sally Doe sally@email.com
Then your code could loop through this list and do something like the following (pseudo code)
 
for (each member in the list)
{
  // grab member name and email address
  // Create and Send an Envelope using name and email address for the recipient info
  // iterate to next member...
}
 
If you are using the REST API to send a signature request you'll want to do a POST method API call on the /accounts/{accountId}/envelopes resource.  See this page for more info:
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/Content/REST%20API%20References/Send%20an%20Envelope.htm
 
If using SOAP API you want to use the CreateAndSendEnvelope() call, see this page:

In the DocuSign system there are two main ways of intiating signature requests- what we call Embedded vs. Remote.  If you are initiating your signature requests through email then you are using the remote method.  If, instead, you do not want your recipients to have to wait for an email to begin the signing process but instead you'd like to immediately start the flow at a time of your choosing, then you can use the Embedded method.  
 
With Embedding you can use URL tokens to initiate the signing (or sending) workflow.  So with embeddeing you could, for instance, add a button to your website where if a user clicks on it (and you already have their name and email address) they are immediately brought into the signing process.  The way it works is you generate an authenticated URL token (which expires in 5 minutes) and all you have to do is navigate the user to that URL and the process begins.
 
Have you seen our API Explorer and API Walkthroughs?  WIth the API Explorer you can make test API calls without writing any code and see the subsequent requests and responses.  The API Walkthroughs demonstrate the 9 most common use cases of the DocuSign REST API, and the last 3 show you how to use the Embedding functionality.  
 
Hope this helps,

For your username, if you're integrator key is 12345, for instance, then you need to add it in square brackets before your email address, and that whole thing becomes your username.  So you'd have something like the following:

I noticed that your code is different than the api walkthrough that you referenced, especially your headers, and I'm wondering if the problem is stemming from there.  For instance instead of setting the CURLOPT_POST header to true you are setting it to the content length it looks like.  It might also be stemming from one of the additional headers you are using, not sure.  As a test, try trimming your headers down to this:
 
	$data_string = json_encode($data);  	$curl = curl_init($baseUrl . ""/envelopes"" );
	curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
	curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true);

It's a little hard to tell from all the code you posted, but let me explain the steps that need to happen and let's make sure you are following all of them.  To use embedding functionality for an envelope with just one recipient, you would do the following:
 
1)  Create an envelope with one recipient- specifying the recipient name, email, and clientUserId.  Let's say the clientUserId is ""User1"", just like you have it.
2)  Send then envelope.
3)  Make a call to RequestRecipientToken() - a successful call generates a URL that you can use to access the sent envelope.
 
Basically it's the same as creating and sending an envelope withouth the use of embedding EXCEPT that you must specify the clientUserId property, and you must reference the same clientUserId value ""User1"" when generating the token. 
 
Can you confirm that you taking these steps and that you are taking them in the correct order?  It's important to note that you must send the envelope first before you can request a recipient URL token.

Also, just as a test to see if its the anchor string that are causing your issue, please try using absolute positioning (i.e. X and X positions) to see if your results vary at all.

I'm adding at once and sending. The response that I posted is from CreateAndSendEnvelope. Are you suggesting the absolute positioning for the offset?

Please try setting the XPosition and YPosition INSTEAD OF creating AnchorTabItems.  I'm wondering if you get different results that way.  
 
Here's an example from the SOAP API Guide.  As you can see there are no AnchorTabItems used here, only absolute positioning.  I understand this workaround might not work for your business needs, but it'll tell us if there's a bug with anchor tab items, or somewhere else.
 
// Create a new signature tab
DocuSignWeb.Tab tab = new DocuSignWeb.Tab();
tab.DocumentID = ""1"";
tab.RecipientID = ""1"";
tab.Type = DocuSignWeb.TabTypeCode.SignHere;
tab.PageNumber = ""1"";
tab.XPosition = ""100"";
tab.YPosition = ""100"";
envelope.Tabs = new DocuSignWeb.Tab[1];
envelope.Tabs[0] = tab;

What I did was create an envelope with 3 embedded recipients, and added one signHere tab for each recipient, and each tab is anchored to document text (i.e. they each use anchorStrings for placement).
 
One thing I want to point out, although it's not required you can actually provide the values for each recipientId and clientUserId instead of having the system generate GUIDs for each those which are hard to read and compare.  You'll see in my test PHP program I've simply used 1, 2, 3 for the recipientIds and clientUserIds.  
 
I'm attaching the code I used to create the envelope with 3 embedded recipients.  Do you notice any major differences?  Perhaps you can try to enter your own credentials and recipient info and run yourself. 
 
NOTE:  THese forums do not allow .php attachments so I've changed to .txt file extension.  Please rename the embedSigning.txt file to embedSigning.php.

Yes REST is much easier and we encourage developers to use that over SOAP.  It has some added functionality that SOAP does not have.  Also, have you see all of our REST tools to help your development?  We have some great tools:
 
API Explorer - You can make test API calls using REST without writing any code!  And you can see the request headers and bodies and the responses as well for each call. 
 
API Walkthroughs - This demonstrates 9 of the most common use cases of the API, and for each use case it has 5 sample languages for you to copy and run.  You just need to enter your credentials at the top.
 
REST API Guide - Similar to the SOAP guide you found but for REST.

It should work using the whole integrator key (i.e. include the 4 letter prefix).  Please confirm you are doing the following:
 
$IntegratorsKey = ""your integrator key GUID here"";

$UserID = ""your login email here"";

$Password = ""your password here"";

$api->setCredentials(""["" . $IntegratorsKey . ""]"" . $UserID, $Password);

Oh, one thing I just noticed... when you are creating the envelope you need to set the AccountId property of the envelope, what are you setting that to?  You should be setting it to your API account Id found on the Preferences -> API page.  Like so:
 
$env = new Envelope();
$env->AccountId = $_apiAccountID; // Note: GUID should be used here

The difference in X/Y coordinates is a big problem still that basically depends on the resolution and quality of the PDF uploaded. So if you're doing it from the server, it is a trial and error process (not ideal at this point). I recommend creating the Template and adding Tabs, then populating the pre-added Tabs through the API.

This should get you going,
1. the first --myboundary needs to start with \r\n--myboundary.
2. attach the document bytes; so get the byte buffer for the file put the document bytes in the appropriate form-part.
 
 
This should work. 
 
for example, when sending a multi-part in node, I send the request in three parts (if sending one file). that's because the moment I append the bytes buffer to the string it changes the encoding.
 
so, I do something like, 
 
var apiCall = http.request(...)
 
apiCall.write(part1)
apiCall.write(part2)
apiCall.write(part3)
 
part 1:
""\r\n--""+requestCall.boundary + ""\r\nContent-Type: application/json"" + ""\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data"" + ""\r\n\r\n""
""\r\n--myboundary"" + '\r\nContent-Type:'+""fileObj.mimeType + '\r\nContent-Disposition: file; filename=""'+ fileObj.name+ '""; documentid='+fileObj.documentId
+' \r\n\r\n'

I truly appreciate it.  Sadly, however, I'm not working with Node.js so I'm unable to submit material exactly in the way that you're recommending. So, instead I'm going to refer back to some code samples that are completely bare-bone that I've replicated on iodocs that I've been using to build this, rebuild this, test, etc. I've deduced at this point, that the problem is most definitely related to how the base64 is being sent.  Here's some examples:  PHP Source without Document Attached: $eol = ""\r\n"";
$mime_boundary = 'myboundary';
$body = '';

$body .= $eol;
$body .= '--' . $mime_boundary . $eol;
$body .= 'Content-Type: application/json' . $eol;
$body .= 'Content-Disposition: form-data' . $eol . $eol;
$body .= $json_body . $eol . $eol;

Response Body (as expected): {
  ""errorCode"":""NO_DOCUMENT_RECEIVED"",
  ""message"":""Bytes for document corresponding to documentId 1 not found in request. 'documentId=' possibly missing from Content-Disposition header.""
}In the above example, I'm expecting to see this error message because I have intentionally failed to attach the document..Now, let's spin this around and attach the PDF base64, and watch the error miraculously appear. PHP Source with base64 PDF: $eol = ""\r\n"";

Response Body: {

  ""message"":""An item with the same key has already been added.""
} And, here we are --- the weird error. So, it's apparently someway related to how I'm sending the B64 attachment.  And it's driving me bonkers. Some PHP and general notes: I've tried to run with chunk_split() and without chunk_split().I've tried numerous PDF files.I've played the ""\r\n"" before the first boundary game and observed no real difference. From what I can tell -- I'm sending the base64 appropriate to what any POST situation would expect.  I can own e-mail attachments with the above syntax -- but the DocuSign system is giving me this serious problem. Per my research on the syntax ""An item with the same key has already been added"" it's a .Net or MSSQL error that bounces back when there is a problem with variable names or duplicate keys in a table.  I'm not sure if that will give any insight. I'd love to hear any further ideas of what I can try to fix this, or further troubleshoot it to discover the root problem.

That's why you only see two tabs twice, not all four twice. The other two tabs exhibited the same behavior for the other recipient, though I did not screenshot that recipient as they were directly on top of one another. This didn't illustrate the problem very well as it visually appeared that the correct number of tabs were present. However, behaviorly it was still a problem, as it caused the signing process to get stuck in a loop. Clicking a Sign tab would place the signature, but there would be another Sign tab behind it. Attempting to click the second Sign tab would result in clicking the placed signature, which undoes the signature and replaces the original Sign tab. The signing process just kept going back and forth between the two documents, never getting past the first set of signatures. I got around it by changing the Anchor Text such that the text for the first document doesnt appear in the second and vice versa. However, that doesn't scale well if you start having larger sets of documents. Even if there are workarounds, it's a pretty major bug that I believe should be high on DocuSign's priority.;1272;N/A;Nitron_F117;0;answer;N/A

When a CreateEnvelope calls returns, you receive the envelope Id, so you can store this information and not need to call our Service to see what envelopes you sent to a particular user.
 
Once you have the envelope ID, you can query for the recipient status within that envelope, but we strongly recommend using DocuSign Connect for envelope status change notifications.";789;N/A;vladcretu;1;answer;N/A

There are two ways to pass member credentials:
* SOAP Header via WS-Security UsernameToken
* HTTP Header via a custom field ""X-DocuSign-Authentication""
The Account Management API only supports the HTTP Header authentication method, while all others can support either method. This request is to Account management, so using the SOAP header you recommended won't work. I noticed in the header of my requests it said the host was: demo.docusign.net even though I am live.  Checking the wsdl files from GitHub, there were 6 instances where the wsdl was pointing to the demo site.  I changed to live and now it seems to work. I've worked past that and now when I try to create an envelope I am getting ""The envelope specified either does not exist or you have no rights to it.""

The message means that the client clock is wrong. The timezone might be set incorrectly.
 
If the SOAP request is timestamped too far in the future or in the past, the server will reject it.  We generally run into this error with mobile apps since folks don't always have their devices set to sync to network time.";942;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

Here on the forums we can't provide help on how one might go about doing a SugarCRM integration, since we really don't know much about SugarCRM.
 
If you'd like, I can put you in touch with our product manager that does integration and maybe you can discuss using our SugarCRM plugin.

Whereas with other objects (ex. Recipients->Recipient) I could build out as described, CustomFields appears to behave a little differently. I'm not certain of this yet, but since you're up against a deadline, I thought I'd think out loud with you.  This revised version no longer fails validation, but I don't see the passed value when I view the submitted Form Data in Dashboard. Works:Spoiler (Highlight to read)$customfield = new CustomField();$customfield->Value = 'my value';$customfield->Name = 'NAMEOFFIELD';$customfield->Show = TRUE;$customfield->Required = TRUE;$customfield->CustomFieldType = 'Text';$env->CustomFields[] = $customfield;$customfield = new CustomField();$customfield->Value = 'my value';$customfield->Name = 'NAMEOFFIELD';$customfield->Show = TRUE;$customfield->Required = TRUE;$customfield->CustomFieldType = 'Text';$env->CustomFields[] = $customfield;Didn't work (but, oddly, same structure does work in Recipients):Spoiler (Highlight to read)$customfield = new CustomField();$customfield->Value = 'my value';$customfield->Name = 'NAMEOFFIELD';$customfield->Show = TRUE;$customfield->Required = TRUE;$customfield->CustomFieldType = 'Text';$env->CustomFields->CustomField[] = $customfield;$customfield = new CustomField();$customfield->Value = 'my value';$customfield->Name = 'NAMEOFFIELD';$customfield->Show = TRUE;$customfield->Required = TRUE;$customfield->CustomFieldType = 'Text';$env->CustomFields->CustomField[] = $customfield;So what's different here is I used to assign $env->CustomFields->CustomField[] = $customfield; which causes a validation error, whereas $env->CustomFields[] = $customfield; passes vaidation and sends the DocuSign request. Does this help?  Can you point me where to see the passed value in Dashboard?

So whenever you retrieve a document list of an envelope there will be a node for each document (which contains several elements such as documentId, name, uri, etc) and the last envelopeDocument will be the certificate.  If your code works but for some reason you're only seeing the certificate come through then I'd first like to ask how many documents you have in the envelope, and how many times does your foreach loop iterate?
 
Next, I see in the code that you are creating the file with this
 
$iscreated = file_put_contents($envelopeId . ""-testing.pdf"", $data);
 
Since the envelopeId stays constant, wouldn't that replace each previous file that you write?  Sorry if I'm mis-understanding that as PHP is not one of my strong points, but I'm wondering if that is maybe why you're only seeing the certificate which is normally the very last document in the list.  Let us know when you get a chance...

With the API Explorer you can plug in your account info at the top of the page, select ""Request Signature"", then request signature from document (not from template), add multiple signers, and then hit the TRY IT button, and you can actually see exactly how the outgoing json is formatted.  
 
This in turn will show you how to constuct your json body to have mutliple signers.  I just did all of that myself and here is the resulting json that was constructed...

I think you should omit this error for now (I'll try to find out what's wrong with InPersonSigners in the API Explorer in the mean time) and you should go ahead and continue coding up your project and start testing when ready.

I get the same error you do when testing with the API Explorer, but if I use the DS member Console and run a test case through there (i.e. add myself as an inperson signer and send) I receive the document with the inperson signing flow correctly attached.  
 
One thing I noticed that was different in my test case was that, in the [signers] array there is one extra element which is called ""clientUserId"" which is set to 1.  According to the documentation if the clientUserId is not null then the recipient is embedded.  To be honest I'm still trying to understand exactly what that means, but as a quick test can you try adding that into your requestBody (i.e. clientUserId = 1) to see if that makes a difference?
 
The only other thing I was curious about was that you have a higher value for the recipientID of the InPersonSigner than the regular signer.  I'm not sure if that would mess things up, but for debugging sake can you please try using recipientID = 1 for the signer and recipientID = 2 for the InPersonSigner?

At the root level of your request, there's an optional element that you can add which is called ""signingLocation"".  The description for it reads like this:
 
signingLocation - Specifies the physical location where the signing takes place. It can have two enumeration values; InPerson and Online. The default value is Online.
 
If the previous two suggestions do not work for you can you also please try adding in this one element at the root level of your request and setting its value to ""InPerson""?

I actually can't really get the json that is created and sent through the DS Console as it's being sent through https and the console doesn't show you the specifics of what's going out.  
 
Did you try adding the ""clientUserId"" element and setting it to value ""1"" as previously mentioned?  Did that make any difference?  I think that is required in addition to the signingLocation element.  
 
Also, just to clarify, when inPerson signing correclty works, what happens is that the person who is hosting the inPerson signing gets an ""InPerson Signing"" workflow that asks them to hand the computer off to the signer, then they go through about 5 or 6 steps to complete the signing.  So when you open the document for the first time you wouldn't see the inPerson signature yet, instead you should be prompted to start the work flow.  
 
One last thing, what happens if you try to do inPerson signing directly through the Console (as I did) using the same recipient info that you are using in your javascript app?  Does it work successfully for you?";1539;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

If those look ok then please provide the part of your code where you're actually sending the document.  The error message seems to indicate that the document is not being attached correctly.
 
[EDIT]
 
I would definitely like to see how you are attaching your document to the envelope, please attach that part of your code.  Are you doing something like this:
 
$env->Documents = array($d);
 
Where $env is the envelope that you are creating?  This post shows how to properly do it in PHP:

I see you mention you are calling envelope->getDocuments() but that does not attach the document.
 
In your for-loop you are creating a document on each iteration and assigning document properties to it, and then you add each document to your documents array with this:
 
array_push($documents, $d);
 
But at some point after you create the array you need to attach your $documents array to your envelope, something like this:
 
envelope->Documents = $documents;
 
Are you doing that in your code?

It would be very helpful in debugging this issue if you could attach a sample SOAP XML trace of what you are sending out.  That will show us exactly what XML is being sent, and I have a feeling we'll see where the problem is.  The schema for this type of request should look like this:
 
<soap:Body>
    <CreateAndSendEnvelope xmlns=""http://www.docusign.net/API/3.0"">
      <Envelope>
        <TransactionID>string</TransactionID>
        <Asynchronous>boolean</Asynchronous>
        <AccountId>string</AccountId>
        <Documents>
          <Document>
            <ID>positiveInteger</ID>
            <Name>string</Name>
            <PDFBytes>base64Binary</PDFBytes>
            <Password>string</Password>
            <TransformPdfFields>boolean</TransformPdfFields>
            <FileExtension>string</FileExtension>
            <MatchBoxes xsi:nil=""true"" />
            <AttachmentDescription>string</AttachmentDescription>
          </Document>
 </Documents>
 
And I'm wondering if we'll see a difference in your trace.  More specifically the error message you're receiving is indicating that it can not find any <Document> element under the <Documents> element.";1448;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

You might be able to get away with zipping it up first then attaching...
 
Looking at the XML you provided, I can see that your document is still not going into your envelope.  Looking at the envelope XML we have this snippet:
 
[AccountId] =>
                                                    [Documents] => Array
                                                        (
                                                        )

                                                    [Recipients] => Array
                                                        (
 
As you can see, the documents array is empty.  It should have things like DocumentID, Name, PDFbytes, etc.  Other parts of your structure you are referencing DocumentID = 1, however that document has still not been defined and added yet.
 
Have you seen the online SOAP API guide?  It has some useful information on how to create and send envelopes.  In particular this page might help:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/APIGuide/Content/Sending%20Group/Create%20and%20Send.htm
 
If you expand any of the code sections you'll see the steps necessary to add a document.  For instance, the PHP code for adding a document to your envelope is: 
 
// Attach the document
$doc = new Document();
$doc->ID = ""1"";
$doc->Name = ""Picture PDF"";
$doc->PDFBytes = file_get_contents(""docs/picturePdf.pdf"");
$env->Documents = array($doc);
 
Notice the last line of code adds the document to the envelope object.";907;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

... I told you that your Documents section of the XML is empty.  Have you done anything to confirm that??  
 
It looks like you're attaching your documents to the envelope based on the code you provided here, but there is obviously a disconnect / bug somewhere in your code as it's not going in.  
 
At this point I'd suggest testing out individual components of your code and making sure they are what you expect.  Add print statements and check variables for correct assignment.  For instance, are you positive your PDF is being read correctly when you do the file_get_contents() function call?  (Based on the XML you provided earlier it does not look like the PDF bytes are going in at all)  And after you assign the $documents array to your envelope, try printing out that array and make sure the documentID, name, and PDF bytes are in there as you'd expect...";695;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

Our IODocs website has both an API Explorer- where you can view sample requests and responses, and API Walkthroughs- where you can view sample code and descriptions.  
 
I see you mentioning the specific use case where you're using the REST API and would like to send a PDF using a template in PHP.  As such, please see this page:
 
http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/requestSignatureFromTemplate
 
The first tab shows how to quickly accomplish this using PHP.  In general two requests are made- the first requests is to authenticate (login) and the second shows how to request a signature on a PDF using a template.  Please note that this PHP example shows how to do this using the JSON format.  Your other option is to use the XML format, which the C# and Java samples illustrate how to do.

Let me explain how templates work real quick in hopes of eliminating any potential confusion and for the benefit of others.  
 
Templates are ""objects"" that contain document(s), recipient(s), recipient roles, routing order, and potentially other data.  I see you mention that you've created 3 templates already... which means you probably realized that you can not save one without supplying at least one document.  This is because templates are useful when the document does not change.   For example, if you need the same document signed by John Doe once a week, then templates are useful here.  
 
However, if your document changes during each request, then you probably don't want to use templates and instead you want to send a multi-part form data request.  The API Walkthrough I referenced in the previous post shows how to request a signature on a doc using a template, which means the document does not change.  The following API Walkthrough (Request Signature Document) illustrates how to make the requests with different documents each time, while specifying things like recipeint(s), routing order, etc. all through the actual API call.  Please have a look at this one as well:

I found a previous thread that might be related to your issue.  I've read that you might need to add the following element to your customTab:
 
CustomTabTypeSpecified => ""true""
 
The SOAP documentation also indicates you might need to add the element
 
TabLabel => ""<your_label_name>""
 
This is the thread where adding the CustomTabTypeSpecified element solved someone's issue, they were using the custom List type but it might apply to your custom text type as well:
http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-NET/CustomTabType-List-Checkbox-not-workin...
 
Please try adding one or both of these to see if that gets your custom text to show...

I've given up on the Custom Tab for now. Since I only have a limited number of documents that require this I decided to use a Template I created with 1 of the documents for testing. This document was working fine when I sent it via PHP/cURL but I needed to change 2 text fields to Date fields. Basically I just put the new Date fields in the same location with the same Conditionals as the text fields had. When I send the Template with an email and name it sends fine but when I open it for Signing the Confirm is already being displayed and it allows me to Confirm without actually Signing it. The Conditions Logic seems to be working fine, when the Initial Tab is Signed the bottom Tabs display when the Initial Tab is Not Signed the Top Tabs are displayed and the Bottom Tabs are hidden. Perfect except that I can Confirm Without Signing. I am including the XML file for the Template for you to look at. Thanks for you help.

And that's also why when you removed the text fields and added date fields instead you started seeing this problem- the text fields are waiting for data to go in them before it thinks the document is ""complete"".
 
To resolve I think you'll need to have at least one non-optional tab.  Otherwise, if you send a doc with only optional tabs that's all they are- they are optional and the recipients don't have to sign them to complete the document.

Yeah you can definitely save two (or more) documents to the same envelope, you probably already know this but if you set the status to ""created"" it will upload the documents into the Envelope and save it as a draft (at that point you'd be able to see it in the Console in your Drafts folder).  Othewise if you set the status to ""sent"" then it will upload into the Envelope and actually send it as well.

Happy Holidays to you as well!  
 
Ok so the structure you're building is not valid for a radio button, that's why it's not showing up.  It's unfortunate that you don't get an error message, I'll discuss that with one or two people, but basically you need to follow the structure that's presented on this page:
 
http://www.docusign.com/p/RESTAPIGuide/Content/REST%20API%20References/Tabs/Radio%20Group%20Tab.htm
 
I wrote a PHP script that puts a working radio button group onto the first page of the first document.  It does not have the conditional formatting that you are trying to use but you should be able to get these buttons to show, then add your conditional elements back in.  
 
I'm pasting a screenshot of my radio tabs, and also pasting the code inline for your review:
 

 
 
""tabs"" => array( ""radioGroupTabs"" => array( array ( ""documentId"" => ""1"",  ""groupName"" => ""RadioGroup1"", ""radios"" => array ( array( ""pageNumber"" => ""1"", ""selected"" => ""true"", ""value"" => ""X"", ""xPosition"" => ""300"", ""yPosition"" => ""75"" ), array( ""pageNumber"" => ""1"", ""selected"" => ""false"", ""xPosition"" => ""350"", ""yPosition"" => ""75"" ) ), ""recipientId"" => ""1"",  ) ), ""signHereTabs"" => array( array( ""xPosition"" => ""100"", ""yPosition"" => ""200"", ""documentId"" => ""1"", ""pageNumber"" => ""1"" ) ) ) )
 
 
Hope this helps...

You run PHP, so you can run our SDK very easily.
 
So, login to our SDK and go to Embed Docusign -> Create Envelope with 2 Signers.
 
In the code - embeddocusign.php line 102 - for the second signer, change it to any emaiil addres you wish.
 
Go through the scenario and you'll see that we'll go through the embedded signing process for both users.
 
 
Hope this helps.

So, you need to create the envelope and specify the username and email of the person that needs to sign. Next you need to get the recipient token and launch it in an iframe, so you can continue the signing process.
 
You can not get a recipient token for a recipient that does not exist in the envelope. 
 
I think we got it now. Right? The recipient we request a token for needs to be a valid recipient of the envelope.

For example, you can pre-tag a document using templates. So, everytime you need to send that document, you use CreateEnvelopeFromTemplate.
 
Or, you can use AnchorTabs, and this places a tab withing an (x,y) offset of a given text. Keep in mind that it will place the tag at every occurence of that text, so you'd need to make sure that the text identifier is unique.

I am currently building out my own tool for this purpose, but still facing a question.  I'll describe the tool below to maybe help answer your question, but my follow on question is: What is the unit of measurement for a tab (not anchor) placement?  The only thing I can find in the docs is that it is in pixels (but that is inferred).  And pixels doesn't seem quite right.  What is the DPI of a DocuSign document? Here is what I've done so far: I have a teplate PDF that I load up from file (you could use bytes directly).I place this into mPDF (http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf/index.php) (I've found this to be the best balance of resources/performance/features for my needs)I have my tab definitions externalized (location, type, etc).I then run through each of these defined tabs and place them on my copy of the PDF #4 requires some effort, and I've built a little gui around the process so I can quickly type in a new tab def, click on preview, and see where the tab will land on my pdf (I happen to pop it up in a fancybox).  This doesn't hit the DS servers, so I can very quickly test a lot of different tab positions.  Once I get it right, I put the tab definition into my code. Since PDF is a print medium, most systems use millimeters to define a location (since the dpi can be variable).  mPDF does it in millimeters, which means I have to convert this to pixels for DS's tab definition (and vice versa for previewing).  By default, most docs are 96 dpi, and there are about 25.4 mm per inch. I'd be happy to share code snippits if desired - but remember I haven't gotten it quite right yet.

I am in the process of trying another approach - more empirical.  As before, this is based on mPDF as my PDF generator/manipulator.  I used a base PDF document and put a millimeter based grid on the document, then sent this doc with grid to DocuSign (DS) with a SignHere at a particular x/y coord set.  This gave me a single comparison for converting x in mm to x in DS.  I then did this 3 times, with x/y values that spanned from upper left to lower right.  I then plotted the x values for the three, and the y values for the three.  They were a straight line, so I assumed the relationship was linear (and gave up the time intensive task).  The formula (using Excel to do the plot->formula, which is why it is so specific), looks like this: Xmm is the x coordinate in the mm based systemXds is the x coordinate in the DS based system(and same for Ys) Xmm = Xds * 0.3514 - 12.312Ymm = Yds * 0.354 - .8829 I don't know why my tests don't cross at 0 on the graph.  So far, this formula is working well.  But, I'm probalby going to try the 72dpi & /150 approach as well.;2649;N/A;gregd;0;answer;N/A

I would like to kick-off the embedded signing process with a PDF document that contains several form fields which include the Adobe Signature boxes.  Based on the documentation for the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms call, I expected that if I do not specify any InlineTemplates or ServerTemplates, then the form fields would be extracted from the PDF and used for the signature process. However, I find that the call fails with the error message ""The Envelope is not Complete. A Complete Envelope Requires Documents, Recipients, Tabs, and a Subject Line.""  This tells me that the fields are not, in fact, being extrapolated from the PDF.  I'm having a difficult time understanding if I have created the fields correctly in Adobe, and whether that is the problem vs. how I am executing the call.  I have attached the simple PDF template I am using for the test here.  Would someone please let me know what I'm doing wrong? Thank you! Shaheeb RoshanMRS IT/ISwww.mrswi.com

Now this might be fine for my signature fields.  But I interpreted the following statement from the documentation to mean that I should not *have* to do so, and that any form fields in the PDF will be automatically extrapolated into the docusign format:  DocuSign SecureFields (Tabs with TabType ""Custom"") are extrapolated from the form itself. Instead of having to define the fields on a Template in advance, they can be derived from the form on the fly.  So.

I just wanted to share some additional information I've discovered after a bit more experimentation.  I've noticed that if I specify a default recipient on the envelope, all available form fields in the document are automatically detected and made available in the embedded signing ceremony.  I didn't immediately make this connection, but the documentation for the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms call does specify that the DefaultRecipient attribute was introduced in order to facilitate exactly this process. However, I'm surprised that the DocuSign process picked up *all* the form fields in the document, and not only the fields that followed the naming conventions indicated in the documentation.  I am now working on understanding how I can tell DocuSign which types of fields to pick up, ideally through some form of regex matching. WIll keep you posted on my progress, but if you can help me short circuit some of this exploration, I would be grateful. Thanks! SR;1538;N/A;mrsitis;0;answer;N/A

Adobe fields are correlated to DocuSign Tabs with the TabLabel property. CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms() allows properties to be set on multiple Tabs using a ""\*"" wildcard character in the TabLabel property. For instance, all of the CoSigner fields can be assigned to the CoSigner Recipient in a single Tab if the fields were named with a common convention such as ""CoSigner_Name"", ""CoSigner_Address"", etc. The Tab below would assign all such fields to RecipientID 2.

Most folks that use PHP point to dsapi.asmx since they perform auth via the X-DocuSign-Authentication header.
 
The error messages implies that you are pointing to api.asmx (expecting <Security><UsernameToken></UsernameToken></Security>)
 
If you indeed what to do auth via the soap headers, keep in mind that the node name is case sensitive so.....make sure that UsernameToken is not UserNameToken or any other variation.
 
Another way to verify differences is to use curl.
 
In this example, the createEnvelopeRequest.xml contains the request body.  If you decide to use curl to see how things work, make sure that you change the SoapAction header to the appropriate method.
 
I find that replaying requests with curl on enviornments that are broken help me figure out what's wrong. 
 
In your case, if you want to use api.asmx, you need to remove the x-docusign-authentication and make sure that xml file contains the auth header. if you dump the request body of a successful post, you'll have the right format.

Question: who is changing parent.location?
 
The iframe is redirected back to your server. Can you please verify that somewhere in your script you don't change parent.location?
 
Since upon OnComplete the iFrame is loaded with content & scripts from your server...somewhere in your script the parent.location gets changed.";689;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

I think that you need to include RequestCertificate to the classmap.
private static $classmap = array('CreateEnvelope' => 'CreateEnvelope','Envelope' => 'Envelope','Document' => 'Document',
 
 
Is it missing? If so, include it. Again, see how CreateAndSendEnvelope is handled.";1108;N/A;vladcretu;0;answer;N/A

You can accomplish this using tabs. 
 
Look at function addTabs() within senddocument.php 
 
A Tab contains the TabTypeCode, and also a location (x,y coordinates) for tab placement.
 
from documentation:
TabTypeCode is a simple type enumerating one of the following possible values: InitialHere or SignHere or FullName or Company or Title or DateSigned or InitialHereOptional or EnvelopeID or Custom or SignerAttachment or SignHereOptional or Approve or Decline.

RequestSenderToken only works for un-sent (new or existing) envelopes since it places the user in the Sending Wizard. 
 
Regarding your application model: 
 We will have one docusign account, and different application users sending/editing envelopes. We do not want them to see other users envelopes while managing their own through the iframe.
 
Each user would have to have their own Docusign account. Otherwise, every user that logs into a DocuSign account will see all envelopes attributed to that account id. The application model you want to enable is not supported.

If you don't want to use templates, you have to get messy.
the recipient<->tabs relationship is set by the recipientID field within the tab element. If the tabs->recipientID does not exist within the recipients array, the tabs disappear. So..you *could* clone an envelope and change -let's say- the first recipients' info (but maintain the id) and things should work. Often times they dont' because this type of envelope handling often leads to error.
A bigger problem with this approach is that often times you will not have the same number of recipients. No matter what, you'd always have to manipute the tabs structure....either create tabs for new recipients or remove tabs for recipients that no longer are around.
So, if you are to create tabs...let's do it the easy way. I'd have a config that tells me the location of the tabs, so every time I'd create an envelope...I'd just put the tabs for all recipients. It's a very simple loop -> for each recipient, put the tabs from this config file (page, (x,y) coordinates, type...etc). This way I would not have to deal with the logic of figuring out which recipientIds I need to keep track off, what tabs I need to add or delete...etc..etc....

The documents that do into the envelope may change from envelope to envelope.  I wouyld like to be able to, in my ClientURLs of my RequestRecipientToken handler, determine which documents the envelope contains.  I need to make this determinination among around 50,000 possible documents or more, so a somewhat complex encoding is needed. It looks like I have these options for properties of a Document: IDLocalIdThe unique ID for the document in the specific envelope.NameLongStringThe name of the document.PDFBytesbase64BinaryThe document byte streamPasswordPasswordThis will be the password for the document.TransformPdfFieldsBooleanOptional element. When set to true PDF form field data will be transformed into document tab values when the PDF form field name matches the DocuSign custom tab TabLabel. The resulting PDF form data will also be returned in the PDF meta data when requesting the document PDF.FileExtensionStringOptional element. File extension of the document. If the document is non-PDF it will be converted to PDF.MatchBoxesStringOptional element. Only used when uploading and editing templates. Matchboxes are used to define areas in a document for document matching when creating envelopes.The Matchbox schema is defined in the Request Template section.AttachmentDescriptionLongStringOptional element. If present, indicates signer will be attaching a document here. The only place I can see to embed a client side document id token is the Name.  The ID might work, but then I'm inventing a mini protocol stuffed into the bits of a positive integer.  The Name might work, but the recipient sees this name during the process, so I don't want it to be filled with gunk. Can anyone else think of a place to pass this type of information?  In another way, can I attach any custom fields of arbitrary strings to a given document within an Envelope? Thanks, Greg;584;2;gregd;0;question;

In each of these methods the DocuSign demo used the method session_id(). The problem with this method is that if you are storing the envelopeId for reaccessing at a later point, the next time you use embedded signing the clientuserid will be different and it will NOT match up with the envelopeId you have stored. This will result in a rejection of the connection. The solution is that if you are going to store the envelopeId you must also store a clientUserId. This clientUserId is associated with your envelopeId and must match in order for embedded signing to begin successfully. Hope this helps. We resolved our issue.;1630;N/A;georgeruddy;0;answer;N/A

The concept is it opens almost instantly after clicking the button in step 1)The user will then make any last minute edits to the PDF. They will then send a link to the lead and have them e-sign it.From what I can gather, the API does not return specific information about the ID or URL to the newly generated contract. it seems like this information is specifically excluded to ensure a contract is, in fact, signed by the lead and not the user.

It sounds like you want to use Embedded Sending. The process for that is:
1) CreateEnvelope. Notice it is not CreateAndSendEnvelope, just CreateEnvelope. You will also specify the Recipient in this API call, or you can do it in the next step manually. The response to this API call includes an EnvelopeID you will use for the next step. 
2) RequestSenderToken. You will include the EnvelopeID in this API call. This API call returns a URL for you to open in a new window or iFrame and take you to the Tagger where you can add additional fields (edit the PDF, basically]) 
3) Display the iFrame to the User (the CRM User I am assuming), they make the edits in the Tagger and click ""Send"" and the Recipient (lead) will get an email with a link to sign the Envelope.";542;N/A;nicholasareed;1;answer;N/A

Captive Recipients are used for Embedded Signing. When you specify a Recipient as Captive, they will NOT receive an email from DocuSign with a link to sign the Envelope. 
 
So you can ""Send"" an Envelope without your Recipient receiving an email. You would then use RequestRecipientToken to get the URL for that Captive Recipient, load it in an iFrame, and let them sign from your website. 
 
If you don't Send (CreateEnvelope or from a Template have ActivateEnvelope = FALSE), then the Envelope is placed in ""Draft"" status and you would not be able to us RequestRecipientToken (until the Envelope is sent wit SendEnvelope).";810;N/A;nicholasareed;0;answer;N/A

The URLs have an expiration time of 5 mins so they will only work for 5 mins.  If it's after 5 mins then you'll need to generate a new URL.
 
What happens if you run the code, generate the URL text that you've provided, then navigate to that URL in a web browser within 5 mins?  It should be opening the DocuSign Console for you...";1077;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

I'm attempting to use the Docusign API to build out a reporting dashboard in Splunk and we're running in to a bit of a problem.  Specifically, we're trying to match up the document statuses in Docusign with the info that we're able to pull via the API but the numbers aren't matching up. I believe one of the challenges might be that envelopes that are being sent and then voided or deleted are moving to the trashcan and then deleted entirely out of Docusign.  However, as the data was imported via the API it's still has legacy info in Splunk. Any ideas on how to reconcile the two? Thanks!Adam;277;0;AdamZuckerman;0;question;

However, when I have the Time Zone used for API setting set to ""UTC"" the logTime indicated by the API for the creation event is actually 09:42:42. If, however, I set the Time Zone used for API setting to North American Pacific Time I get the expected result of 01:42:42. Is there something I'm not getting about how this should be working, or is the API actually incorrectly offsetting the time? I know Pacific TIme is used elsewhere in the API, but it doesn't seem to make much sense to have this as a setting if the API incorrectly offsets the time.

This message might have already been relayed to you, but this is what engineering said about the Timezone:
 
The REST API returns date/time in ISO8601 UTC format only. They would have to convert on the client side.
 
Is your timing issue possibly related to converting the date using a different standard?";343;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A
31/01/2012 14:49;false;135;Moving Templates from Demo to Production;http://community.docusign.com/t5/DocuSign-API-Integration-PHP-READ-ONLY/Moving-Templates-from-Demo-to-Production/td-p/7347;"Is there a recommended way to move a Template from Demo to Production? There is no ""CreateTemplate"" method, so I'm using combinations of RequestTemplate, UploadTemplate, and SaveTemplate to try and mimic functionality.
 
When using UploadTemplate, I get the standard SOAP ""Unspecified Error"" using a downloaded Template XML file. 
 
Current process:
1) Download Template XML from Demo Console
2) Add template.xml to web directory
3) Run following code
$blank_file_path = ROOT.DS.APP_DIR.DS.WEBROOT_DIR.'/files/blank_template_upload.xml';

// Read the blank Template
$blank_template_xml = file_get_contents($blank_file_path);

// Upload a blank Template
$uploadTemplateParams = new UploadTemplate();
$uploadTemplateParams->AccountID = DS_PROD_ACCOUNT_ID;
$uploadTemplateParams->TemplateXML = $blank_template_xml;
$uploadTemplateParams->Shared = False;

try {
	$response = $prodApi->UploadTemplate($uploadTemplateParams);
} catch (SoapFault $e) {
	pr($prodApi->__getLastRequest());
	pr($prodApi->__getLastResponse());
	pr('SOAP fault: 20007');
	exit;
}
 
This causes the unspecified error.

In respose to your questions:No I am not entirely sure I am entering credentials correctly. Does the API Explorer really access the system? If so, since that appears to be working then I think I am entering my credentials correctly. Since this is merely a development account, you could contact me offline for credentials and see if it works for you. I am running PHP 5.4.14. PHPInfo() shows curl enabled. I think curl is working because I can run a short curl script which seems to work.;820;N/A;MG;0;answer;N/A

You actually have a newer version of PHP, I'm using version 5.3.5.  I doubt that would be the issue but keeping that in the back of mind.
 
That's really weird, the code works for me just fine, and it sounds like you are entering the correct credentials. Is there anything else in your PHP file, like above this code?

That might be a solution for you here.  Basically you can set the placement of your tags based on content found in the document, and especially if you are programmatically creating the document you can add anchor tags anywhere it makes sense and place Stick-eTabs at those locations.  Furthermore, with anchor tabs you can set a units of measurement for the x and y positions of your tabs, the default is pixels but you can also have mms, cms, inches etc.

When you say that you are ""reading from your document IDs that you have on file"", what's a documentId to you?  We need an envelopeId to check here.  Our system has both envelopeIds and documentIds so I want to make sure you're entering the correct one.  I also see a reference to an echo_sign table so I want to make sure you're not getting your IDs mixed up.  Do your values $esdockey look something like the envelopeId I had hardcoded in my example?  It should be a 32 digit string (not including the dashes)";768;N/A;Ergin;0;answer;N/A

I actually did another test and removed the code where I read my file to grab the envelope IDs.  I just hard coded a valid envelope ID and still got the same thing.  The code was as simple as this.  Can you read the same envelope I am and see if you get the same results?   $api_endpoint = ""https://demo.docusign.net/api/3.0/api.asmx"";    $api_wsdl = ""api/APIService.wsdl"";    $api_options = array('location'=>$api_endpoint,'trace'=>true,'features' =>         SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS);    $api = new APIService($api_wsdl, $api_options);    $api->setCredentials(""["" . $IntegratorsKey .

My table definitely has the correct envelope id since when I try to pull the status (with code below) it works fine, just not the auditevents.     $RequestStatusParams = new RequestStatus();    $RequestStatusParams->EnvelopeID = $envelopeID;    $result = $api->RequestStatus($RequestStatusParams);    $envStatus = $result->RequestStatusResult;        $newstatus = $envStatus->Status;";767;N/A;ginasodl;0;answer;N/A

The only other difference I see between our code is that you immeidately print the $response but I return it from a function then print it.  I doubt it, but I'm wondering if something weird is happening because of that.  It's grasping for straws but can you try returning then printing from the calling code, just as an insanity check?  
 
Also, how old are these envelopes that you are testing with?  Were they created within the past few weeks or longer?
 
One last thing, I'm wondering if there's a setting somewhere that I have set in my account that you don't, that would be affecting this.

But that's not a SOAP dump/trace- you'll still need to create one, which is not hard.  You should be able to use the links I provided or google to find one that will create the trace.  In the end it will create an XML file that shows your full request that would go out including headers, all the soap elements, etc.
