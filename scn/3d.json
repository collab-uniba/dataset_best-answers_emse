The SAP system calls Web services to start and stop conversion jobs on the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Generator system, and the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Generator calls Web services to log statuses on the SAP system.Both sides require authentication to call Web services. This requires client certificates to be mapped to users on both sides. The systems therefore need to identify and authenticate the other sides certificate.This section explains how the certificates are implemented, exchanged, and mapped to a user.Personally the other method is much easier to implement.I hope this helps in some way.Kind RegardsFergal.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:3d visual enterprise generator 8.0", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

The 3D Viewer enables free distribution of sophisticated viewing, collaboration, publishing and markup capabilities to everyone in the enterprise.You may also look at a new HTML 5 Viewer that requires no download.

However, the 3D viewing capabilities should have been unaltered since 8 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpVmVIp5a2w) and the (3D) Acrobat JavaScript API too (http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf and http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_3d_api_reference.pdf). On the other hand, your templates may be originated from LiveCycle Designer which relies on a slightly different JavaScript API from Acrobat's. I am not sure but I think that also the LiveCycle Designer which used to be shipped with Acrobat Pro 9 is mostly compatible with the latest standalone version. Finally, the low-level C++ API which is needed to write Acrobat plug-ins such as your RHTemplateDesigner.api is almost certainly not changed since Acrobat 9.////////////////////////////I have 2 example that show live the \"error\" in the pdf.

The best approach is to map ViewerSamples as a local internet site (which gives it implicit permission to load other files) and open it from a URL e.g. http://localhost:8080/index.html If you do want to load directly off disk then you will need to disable web security for your browser.

But without success. But my JT doesn't contain this metadata respectively I can't see it. I only have CADMetadata in my JT.And I'd like to higlight the part in the viewer via the Tag CADMetadata\\Parameters\\NH_MATNR:Here are some combinations I tried, to receive Metadata from the viewer:I pass to IV_ID_FIELD your suggestinon (SAP\\MATERIAL\\0) when I load the file. Result: At Event SAP_VISUALIZATION I get an entry in IT_VISUALIZATION when I higlight a part in the viewer. But this entry doesn't deliver the ID of this part. So I call the method IF_GUI_VIEWER_CONSUMER_MODEL~REQUEST_METADATA from my event handler. Result: At event SAP_METADATA I get no entries in IT_METADATA.I pass my tag CADMetadata\\Parameters\\NH_MATNR: during loading the file. The result is the same like in 1I leave IV_ID_FIELD empty ($RH.POSID will be set by the system). Now I get entries in IT_VISUALIZATION at SAP_VISUALIZATION and also entries in IT_METADATA at SAP_METADATA. This is allright for me.But in the other direction to highlight viewer parts from SAP I tried also with different combination, but without success.Are there any prerequisites the JT file has to fullfill?Thanking you in anticipationJrgen", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:VEV from SAP GUI (monolithic JT): How to receive highlighted parts from VEV and highlight parts in VEV", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Im not seeing anything in the documentation that indicates this is existing functionality but I wanted to confirm that this indeed does not exist.

This type is our current way to highlight selected objects in the viewport.Child highlighting. We have a separate color to highlight children of selected objects to distinguish them from directly selected objects. (If a child of a selected parent is itself directly selected then Selection highlighting is applied to the child, see p.2 below.)User-defined highlighting. This type is used when users specify colors for highlighting objects in tool like QueryUI, StepView Highlighting, Analytics, etc.2. If several types of highlighting are applicable to an object then the color of highlighting type with higher priority will be used. e.g. a user highlighted an object with orange color by running a query and then selected it in the scene tree or viewport, the object is highlighted with red color because primary selection highlighting overrides user-defined highlighting.RegardsPaul", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Highlight colors in embedded viewer via SDK", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

This has worked well with the 7.0 SDK with selecting all of the 'scene tree folder' assembly which included all if the individual child parts of the selected assembly. Our prerequisite was to instruct the end user to change the child color to red, to match the selected object color in the preferences options directly in the VE Viewer 7.0 before opening the 7.0 SDK based user interface. This preference carried through to the embedded VE viewer in the 7.0 SDK based user interface. With the 8.0 SDK, the child color preferences do not carry over into the embedded VE Viewer 8.0 in the 8.0 SDK based user interface. Is there a method we can use to ensure these color choice preferences carry into the embedded 8.0 VE Viewer in the 8.0 SDK based user interface as in 7.0?Legacy compatibility with ongoing projects is of particular importance to ourselves and to our customers. If this is possible, please let us know. I'm the lead VE Author production on this project, however, I'm not the lead 8.0 SDK and VE Viewer implementing software engineer, who may have some additional questions/postings shortly.If this has already been explained in your previous post, my thanks.Best regards,Bill", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Highlight colors in embedded viewer via SDK", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},
