Then I created an append structure for the underlying\ntransparent table with a single field and a view append for the view I use as\ndata source. When I then execute a query on the Collection I get back exactly\nthe same view data as before, i.e. without the appended field.\n\n\n\nThe SAP help documentation (like above) tells us that:\n\n\n\n_At runtime SAP NetWeaver Gateway classes (model provider class and data\nprovider class) consider the fields in the extension includes in ABAP\nDictionary structures. That means that entity sets that are technically based\non ABAP Dictionary structures for which SAP provides the option to extend them\nvia append structures will automatically show new properties if the underlying\nABAP Dictionary structure has been enhanced by the customer. This process is\ncalled Simple Field Extensibility (SFE). Properties that have been created by\nusing SFE contain the annotation sap:is-extension-field=\"true\"._\n\n\n\nI supposed that this works with append views as well, and am a bit astonished\nthat it doesn't seem to work with my example.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have some experience with using the Simple Field Extensibility\nfeature?", "views": "146", "answers": 5, "author": "Valentin Huber", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": "sap_netweaver_gateway.extensibility.gateway.odata"},

They allow you to describe a pattern that can be reused in entities. An\naddress complex type is a good example.\n\n\n\nThe Gateway design abstract only supports flat structures, you cannot design a\n'deep' entity. In order to obtain what you are looking for, such as sales\norder and items, you need to implement both as separate entities. You then\nestablish a relation between them by an association and provide a navigation\npath by adding the association as a navigation property to the parent\n(\"header\" entity).\n\nOnce this has been done, the client can request the order and its items in one\nfeed by using the $expand system query option.\n\nConversely, the client can also create a sales order header and items if a\ndeep insert method is implemented.\n\nMy advice is to concentrate on the simple entities first to become familiar\nwith concepts and practical building, then work up to the more complex\nfeatures. Hopefully, knowing these are possible will prevent you worrying that\nyou are wasting time or that Gateway is not able to do certain things. We have\nto start thinking differently when it comes to Gateway.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nRon Sargeant", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Gateway Service Builder.

Lets say we want to\nwrite an RFC that retrieves Sales Orders related data based on certain input\ncriteria.\n\n\n\nNow, each sales order will have One Header and Multiple Line Item data. Also\nthe result of the RFC could be multiple Sales Orders - i.e. multiple sales\nOrders. Refer the below image. It is one output table that contains Sales\nOrder data. Further, each record has inline item data (or nested table with\nitem records).\n\n[![Sales_Order_Header_Item_inline.JPG](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/\ndownloadImage/2-14365174-281556/Sales_Order_Header_Item_inline.JPG)](http://sc\nn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-14365174-281556/Sales_Order_Header_I\ntem_inline.JPG)\n\nSo, if we need to retrieve Sales Order data and Item data in one read, we need\nto implement GET_EXPANDED_ENTITY and GET_EXPANDED_ENTITYSET where you would\npopulate the complex output structure.\n\n\n\nThe output XML(on using $expand in the URL) would have following structure\n\n(Please note this is a pseudo XML for understanding purpose only)\n\n\n\n&lt;Sales Order # 1&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 1&gt;1&lt;/Item # 1&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 2&gt;2&lt;/Item # 2&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 3&gt;3&lt;/Item # 3&gt;\n\n&lt;/Sales Order # 1&gt;\n\n&lt;Sales Order # 2&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 1&gt;4&lt;/Item # 1&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 2&gt;5&lt;/Item # 2&gt;\n\n&lt;/Sales Order # 2&gt;\n\n&lt;Sales Order # 3&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 1&gt;6&lt;/Item # 1&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 2&gt;7&lt;/Item # 2&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 3&gt;8&lt;/Item # 3&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 4&gt;9&lt;/Item # 4&gt;\n\n&lt;/Sales Order # 3&gt;\n\n&lt;Sales Order # 4&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 1&gt;10&lt;/Item # 1&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 2&gt;11&lt;/Item # 2&gt;\n\n &lt;Item # 3&gt;12&lt;/Item # 3&gt;\n\n&lt;/Sales Order # 4&gt;\n\n\n\nNow in the above example, nested table for item data is as good as a field in\nthe output structure.\n\n\n\nNow, this gives me an idea!! :-)\n\n\n\nBased on this example, theoretically we can have multiple nested tables as\nfields of the output structure. So multiple table read in one RFC call should\nbe possible if you have all the output tables as nested tables in the output\nstructure. So, the output structure would still be a table with only one\nrecord and all the actual output tables would be nested tables. Please see the\nexample below.\n\n\n\nThis would be an output structure with field named \"Data\" and nested tables.\n\n[![Multiple Nested Tables.JPG](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download\nImage/2-14365174-281615/Multiple+Nested+Tables.JPG)](http://scn.sap.com/servle\nt/JiveServlet/showImage/2-14365174-281615/Multiple+Nested+Tables.JPG)\n\nAs you can see Table # 1, Table # 2 and Table # 3 are as good as field like\n\"Data\" in the output structure.\n\n\n\nI think using this approach you should be able to get the data of all the\noutput tables in one RFC fetch.\n\n\n\nI have not tried it practically, but yes theoretically, I think you should be\nable to meet your requirement using the above mentioned approach.\n\n\n\nTry it. I believe this should work.\n\n\n\nPlease check and let me know your findings or observations.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJiten", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:Netweaver Gateway : Multiple Output Tables : Odata", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

A dump state should not be normal operational expectation! i.e. you expect to get these in development, but you iron them out to be production-ready.\n  3.

We had more than one back-end\nsystems to fetch data from. So we didn't want to embed a Gateway server in\neach.

A fix\nwill be available in the next patch release:\n\n    1. In the file system, open the folder, _**Eclipse** _\\--&gt; _**plugins** _and find the JAR file, _com.sap.odata.dt.cons.toolkit.ios_\n    2. Extract the content of the JAR file into a folder in your file system.\n    3. Find and copy the folder, _**res/SDMLibs/iOS,**_ in the extracted content.\n    4. Create a new folder called, _**Temp/IOSODataSDK**_ (case sensitive), and place the copied **iOS** folder into it.   \nYou should have the SDM libs in the following folder structure:\n_**/Temp/IOSODataSDK/iOS/**_\n\n    5.

They\nhave 3 clients in their development system. One is used for customization.\nOne is used for workbench. And the last is their de facto QA system.\n\n\n\nThe last client (\"QA\") is set to not modifiable. The first two clients have\nno master data on them at all, so we cannot test in either of those clients.\nThe Netweaver Gateway configuration is done in 100 and transported across to\n110 and 300. So the system aliases are setup.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the service is successful in the workbench client. When we\nregister the service, we get a green traffic signal and are able to test it in\nthe workbench client. Because there is no data, we can only do a metadata\ntest.\n\n\n\nHowever when we log onto the third client (\"QA\"), and maintain the service,\nthe green traffic signal is replaced by a yellow yield signal. If we click on\n\"register\", we are told that the service has already been registered. If we\nmaintain it, there is no system alias assigned to the service. Because fo\nthis, when we test the service, we get an error. We cannot delete the service\nand re-register it again because of the not modifiable setting.\n\n\n\nI realize this setup is a bit unorthodox, but customers are customers.\nBesides asking the customer to unlock the third client, are there any other\nsuggestions someone would suggest?\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nGareth", "views": "111", "answers": 2, "author": "Gareth de Bruyn", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ""},

I kind of wonder if the introduction of the tooling\nis the problem rather than a deliberate restriction. the reason I say that is\nif you look at the example in the note (which has nothing to do with my\nquestion) [1695674 - Support for optional parameters in function\nimports](http://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1695674) \\- you'll see them\nrefer to the following function import definition:\n\n&lt;FunctionImport Name=\"FunctionImportWithOptionalParameter\"\nReturnType=\"Edm.Binary\" m:HttpMethod=\"GET\"&gt;&lt;Parameter\nName=\"OptionalParameter\" Type=\"Edm.String\" Nullable=\"true\"/&gt;\n\n\n\nwhich has an Edm.Binary return type - This is GW 2.0, but I'm guessing we've\nlost this.\n\n\n\nRegardless, I've just used the Complex Type and moved on.

If there are any exceptions to these rules, or some addtitional\nrules, please post.\n\n\n\n**Rule 1**\n\nUse the Edm type **datetime**. Don't maintain dates as edm.string \"for\nconvenience\"\n\n\n\n**Rule 2**\n\nMake the property nullable if a null value is possible. If there is a need for\na value (mandatory) do not make it nullable.\n\n\n\n**Rule 3**\n\nThe nullable attribute can only be correctly evaluated if the backend date\ncontains '00000000' as a value. ABAP date values containing spaces (this is\nallowed unfortunately) will not be treated as null, but also not be able to\nconvert to an edm.datetime - you will get a runtime error from the server.\n\n\n\n**Rule 4**\n\nBe aware of the **full **property definition. Giving your \"date property\" a\ntype of edm.datetime alone is not enough to ensure proper conversion during\nOData parsing. See rules 5, 6 &amp; 7.\n\n\n\n**Rule 5**\n\nIf the date property is part of a DDIC structure used for the entity\ndefinition, and that component is a DATS (elementary D type), then you can\nplace a D type value in it directly, e.g.\n\n\n\n[![Untitled-1 copy.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2\n-14455587-302351/478-143/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/Jive\nServlet/showImage/2-14455587-302351/Untitled-1+copy.png)\n\n[![Untitled-1 copy.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2\n-14455587-302304/276-83/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveS\nervlet/showImage/2-14455587-302304/Untitled-1+copy.png)[![Untitled-1 copy.png]\n(http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-14455587-302305/476-58\n/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-1445\n5587-302305/Untitled-1+copy.png)\n\n\n\nValid ABAP:\n\n\n\n ls_entity-date = sy-datum.\n\n  \n\nDates of this type can fall into the \"date is null but not valid\" trap\nmentioned in rule 3.  \n\n\n\n**Rule 6**\n\nIf the date property is **not **part of a DDIC structure and the entity\ndefinition is \"freeform\", you can also place a D type value in it directly if\nyou assign its backend data typing: e.g..\n\n\n\n[![Untitled-1 copy.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2\n-14455587-302352/263-71/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveS\nervlet/showImage/2-14455587-302352/Untitled-1+copy.png)[![Untitled-1 copy.png]\n(http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-14455587-302353/450-35\n/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-1445\n5587-302353/Untitled-1+copy.png)\n\n[![Untitled-1 copy.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2\n-14455587-302360/450-171/Untitled-1+copy.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/Jive\nServlet/showImage/2-14455587-302360/Untitled-1+copy.png)\n\n\n\nDates of this type can fall into the \"date is null but not valid\" trap\nmentioned in rule 3.\n\n\n\n**Rule 7**\n\nIf the date property is **not **part of a DDIC structure, the entity\ndefinition is \"freeform\" and there is no backend data typing, the target must\nbe filled as if it were a timestamp; this is because the MPC generated\nproperty type is a packed type field.

I am using Postman to test the Gateway service. I have\ndeveloped small RFC FM to read return list of deliveries for a shipment. The\nRFC reads in a shipment number and returns the list of deliveries. The RFC\nalso has Return parameter of type BAPIRET2 that stores the error message if\nshipment is not found. We want to use only JSON format for the application.\nSo, I have set the 'Accept' parameter at request header to 'content/json'. I\nam also aware of the exception /IWBEP/CX_MGW_BUSI_EXCEPTION that allows to\nthrow an error message from backend suite. I have that by having a Return\nparameter of type BAPIRET2, the generated method automatically handles the\nerror message and sets the correct HTTP status.\n\n\n\nNow the Problem:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we want to use JSON format. When I set the header\nparameter or specify $format=json in the URI the HTTP status code is always\nset to 500 when there is an error. The error message about invalid shipment\nalso is not returned.\n\n\n\nWhen I remove the JSON format parameters, the XML format is returned and HTTP\nstatus is set to 400 with appropriate error message.\n\n\n\nHow can we get the Gateway to set the HTTP status code to 400 along with error\nmessage in the event of an error in RFC.

The runtime objects (model\nprovider classes and data provider classes) are independent from those of the\nfirst project.\n\n\n\nBy redefining the project you can select which entities and which associations\nyou want to use in your child project. Those redefined objects can't be\nchanged in the child project, you only can redefine names and labels. On the\nother hand if you change any of the redefined object attributes in the parent\nproject the changes will also be available in the child project.\n\nAnd the data provider class of the child project inherits from the one of the\nparent project.\n\n\n\nSo you have a real parent-child relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nRedefining with option \"Extend\" means to add objects of the parent project,\nwhich haven't been redefined before.\n\n\n\nRedefining with option \"Overwrite\" means to redo the redefinition. All\nredefinitions done earlier will be overwritten. Objects which had been\nredefined before, but are not selected in the new redefinition will be deleted\nfrom the child project.\n\n\n\nHope that makes it a little bit clearer.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nJuergen", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:SEGW : Copy Project vs Redefine(OData Service)", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

It certainly does have\na relation to the original project, as it is a copy! Why not build a new\nproject otherwise?\n\nThe difference is that none of the classes are copied, only the project\ndefinition. Instances of runtime artifacts are not included because they are\nnot part of the project object, they are a by-product of it.\n\nThe classes of a service have no connection (from the class) back to the\nproject, e.g. you can delete the project and the service still works.\n\nYou can opt to not copy the data model but that does seem a bit pointless.\nLikewise 'service implementation' can be opted out. I think this means RFC\nmapping, if there is one. Since I abhor RFC services I would not\nknow.![](http://scn.sap.com/1336/images/emoticons/laugh.gif)\n\nBTW, \"Service implementation\" is totally the wrong name for this part of a\nproject, why not 'Service Mapping\" ?.\n\n\n\nTo summarise, copy is only of any use when you wish to make a copy of the\n**data model** and change it.

The first parameter of this callback function is oData = a js object\nwhich contains the result. For this particular situation (in which the\nFunction Import return value cardinality is 0..n or 1...n , i.e. a table) the\noData object will have the following structure:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n     \"d\":\n     {\n     \"__metadata\":\n     {\n     \"type\":\"Collection(<<complex type name>>)\"\n     },\n     \"results\":\n     [ \n     /* an array of data records */\n     ]\n     }\n    }\n\n So you will be interested only in oData.d.results array (which will\ncontain the 'real' data retrieved from your backend system). My suggestion\nwould be to create a [sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel](https://sapui5.hana.ondeman\nd.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel.html) from this array\nand then use it for data binding within a list / table. You can do this\ndirectly inside the callback function's body. Example code:\n\n    \n    \n    var model = new sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel(oData.d.result); \n     var list = new sap.m.List();\n     list.setModel(model);\n     list.bindItems({\n     path : \"/\", \n     template : new sap.m.DisplayListItem({ label: \"{name}\" })\n     });\n\n Here you can also see a working example based on the code above:\n<http://jsbin.com/lofamamina/1/edit?html,output>\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSerban", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:How to call Function Import from SAP UI5 and get the return object in\ntable?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

If you are\nasking in terms of ABAP code, there are pretty clear comments mentioned in the\ngenerated code. Let me try to explain a generalized code of both methods.\n\n\n\nIn GET_ENTITY:\n\nFirstly there is variable declaration part where we define the structures or\ncontainers for FM import, export parameters, RFC destination etc. Then there\nis code written to fetch the keys from the HTTP request. The code below this\nextracts the RFC destination to call the FM from the system alias associated\nwith the service. Then it calls the FM based on the RFC destination. If any\nerror occurs during this or there is an error msg coming in return table, the\ncode below this handles errors. Then the response from the FM is transferred\nto the er_entity structure.\n\n\n\nIn GET_ENTITYSET:\n\nThe same variable declaration part. Then we extract the filters from the HTTP\nrequest. The long CASE statements extracts the filter values and put in the\ncontainers. Then RFC destination extraction and calling of FM followed by\nerror handling part. Then there comes the code which handles paging. The\npaging is handled by 'skip' &amp; 'top' parameters. 'Skip' means that skip the\nmentioned no. of records from the response while 'Top' means the maximum no.\nof records to be processed from the starting (e.g.: for the first time you may\nrequest skip=0 and top=100, then you will get top 100 records. After this you\nmay request skip=100 and top=200, then you will get the next 100 records\nstarting from 101 and ending at 200). Then we loop the output table based on\nthe skip, top values and transfer the values to the et_entityset table.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nEkansh", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:What do 'GetEntitySet (Query)' & 'GetEntity (Read)' do.", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

You\ncreate a new service in SEGW, and choose Data Model -&gt; Extend -&gt; OData\nService (GW).\n\n\n\n[![Extend.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-15707266\n-633284/450-269/Extend.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/\n2-15707266-633284/Extend.png)\n\n\n\nThis opens the Redefine Service Wizard, where you select your existing service\nwith existing version number, e.g. 0001.

Particularly, you are free to break up results of one\nfunction module into several entity types, if appropriate.\n\n\n\nIf the export parameters of the function module are individual fields as well\nas a table, you will _have_to_ model separate entity types: one for the \"main\"\nentity type consisiting of the individual fields, and another one for the\n\"dependent\" entity type which reflects the structure of one line of the table.\n\n\n\nThen you can add an association between the main entity type and the dependent\nentity type. After that, you can add a navigation property from the main\nentity type to the dependent entity type. Thus, if your client requests one\nmain entity, the result will include a link to the set of dependent entities,\nand the client can follow that link to receive all the entities which\ncorrespond to the table entries of the function module.\n\n\n\nThis structure is necessary, because OData services follow the REST webservice\nparadigm. REST makes the development of client applications much easier, but\none condition for that is, that there are no table attributes in entity types.\nThere are entities as flat structures, and there are sets of entities. If\nthere is an entity which is linked to several datasets with the same\nstructure, then this situation has to be modeled as separate entity types with\na 1:m relationship.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nRingo", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Issue while creating web service with structure input and table output", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

I am using NW Gateway (backend, not HUB\ndeployment) to expose Odata web services. I have managed to expose and read\ndata on client 001, where i also made all the customizing neccessary to enable\nthe NW Gateway, maintain system aliases etc..\n\n\n\nNow, since all the demo data for IDES is in client 800, i don't know how to\nconfigure NW Gateway and system aliases so that i can expose data from client\n800. I have searched for an answer to this a lot, but most of the information\ni could find was for a HUB deployment.Also, if i login to client 800, i can\nsee that the customizing settings for NW Gateway are not there. So i have a\ncouple of questions:\n\n  1. How do i set-up my NW Gateway and system aliases to expose data also from client 800?\n  2. Aren't gateway customizing settings cross-client? How come the gateway is disabled in client 800 but enabled in 001 on the same system?\n  3.

But how to have a dev/prod\nscenario on a single embedded deployment, i have yet to find out. By this i\nmean how to have a service definition in client 100 that you can transport to\nclient 800 (using ie. SCC1) on demand, so these two clients can use different\nservice definitions.

With simple function module\nparameters, filtering will only work with one condition of sign 'EQ', not with\nseveral conditions or with other comparison signs. Only if the function module\nhas range table parameters (selection tables), the code will be generated for\nall comparison signs and for more than one condition.\n\n\n\nB) If there are filter attributes left for which A) does not work, then you\nwill have to write you own ABAP code for filtering on them. Redefine the\ngenerated method PROJECTLISTSET_GET_ENTITYSET in your Data Provider Extension\nClass ..._DPC_EXT. In the redefined method, first call the method of the base\nclass (the code will already be there: CALL METHOD super -&gt; ... ). Then\ntake the result table et_entityset from that call and identify and copy only\nthe rows matching your additional filter criteria to a new table of the same\ntype, which you can assign to et_entityset as final result.\n\n\n\nIn the example request in your post, FIELDNAME eq 'VKORG' and FIELDNAME eq\n'VTEXT' seems a bit unsual to me - as the attribute fieldname can only have\none value at one time, I expect that the condition will never be fulfilled and\nyour result set will always be empty.\n\n\n\nBest regards and lots of success,\n\nRingo", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 1, "title": "Re:Pass multiple values to a field in filter with and condition", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Then for paging, only implement non-standard\nutility paging if required since it's rarely a simple task and if you can load\nthe records in 100ms or less, then you might as well page the entityset with\nthe utility anyway.\n\n\n\nIn short, the standard for paging should be the utility class; unless the\ndataset is too large, or complex to allow that then you should do the most\nappropriate paging you can with (1) above being a recommendation if the\nentity-set retrieval allows that.\n\n\n\nOr, maybe the standard should just say - please use one of your more\nadvanced/experienced ABAP'ers if paging if required\n![](http://scn.sap.com/1336/images/emoticons/silly.gif)\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMatt", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:How do you write your EntitySet Paging?", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

Similarly, using open search rather than\n$filters is really the only way to really get a google like search occurring,\nbut that can make life difficult for a UI5 developer since it's not an\nautomated binding, so overloading the definition of a filter (including what\ncontains means) for a field could be much more efficient (albeit a little\ncryptic but the service was built for the UI so tough :-) One example I did\nwas for employee, and the search for employee with a contains implied\nsearching for that person's name, their managers name, their position, their\nlocation. Horrible from a purist perspective, but it's the most maintanable\nsolution once you get past how dodgy it feels.\n\n\n\nBTW - I use the io_tech_request_context-&gt;has_count( ) wherever I can\n(especially since UI5 lists like to ask for the count before ask for the paged\nentities), but oddly enough the system I was working on yesterday actually had\na bug and passed back 0 all the time!

Any device which can\nlisten and speak HTTP can consume SAP Data through OData services. OData\nservices will be RESTful webservices. Using SAP Gateway to connect front-end\nto back-end systems also makes an abstraction layer from front end to back\nend. Now front end system need not to know about the backend system and how\nthat data is coming from there. You can use multiple backends connected to\ngateway but front end will communicate to only gateway which in turn will call\ndifferent backends. So yes, it is advised to use OData services in order to\nexpose sap data.\n\nYes, it will support network load. Its pretty fast and supports paging option\nas well. So you need not to load all 50k records in one shot instead keep on\nloading few records as per pagination.\n\nSyclo Agentry framwork and Fiori support gateway. Fiori is the new UX for SAP\nwhich is built using SAPUI5 and SAP Gateway.\n\nSAP Gateway services can be consumed by any programming language which can\nconsume REST webservices. SAP Gateway only supports SAP backend systems and\ndoes not support native connection to any other backend like JDBC, ODBC etc.\nSAP Gateway can connect to other data sources if they can expose OData or\nwebservices.\n\n\n\nYou may like to read these links:\n\n[SAP NetWeaver Gateway - Technical\nBrief](http://whealy.com/sap/Gateway/Technical%20Brief/)\n\n[Getting Started with SAP NetWeaver\nGateway](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-24763)\n\n[SAP Gateway Self-Paced Learning - Technologies - SCN\nWiki](http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=318672261)\n\n\n\nRegards,  \nEkansh", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:How the performance oData comparing RFC's", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},

So the flow continues to the DPC\nclass &amp; methods on the PGD system and only data is fetched from the ICD\nsystem using RFC.\n\nIf local app is not checked, the gateway framework would get to know that the\nDPC/MPC classes are on backend system and thus flow would be transferred to\nthe ICD system.\n\n\n\n**Role of Trust &amp; RFC destination:**\n\nRFC destination is mandatory in order to communicate between two systems but\nthe trust is not mandatory. You can use untrusted RFC destination as well but\nyou will always login to the backend system with fixed user. This will make\ntracking of user's activity very difficult.

There are two aspects in this:\n\n\n\n**1\\. Passing multiple values as filter in GET_STREAM:**\n\nyou can handle this by making a generic property say 'EmpFilter' of type\nstring. Concatenate all selected employee ids with some predefined\nseparator(like '~' or '|') and then pass it to the EmpFilter property. You can\nsplit this string and fill an internal table in the get_stream code in order\nto pass to the RFC that will give you the PDF. The URI would look like:\n\n/EmployeeIPROSet(EmpFilter='101~102~103~104')/$value\n\nwhere 101, 102 etc are employee ids.\n\n\n\n**2\\. PDF generation:**\n\nThis requirement can be handled with smartform. ABAPer can create a smartform\nwhich uses a loop and populate details of the passed employee ids. Otherwise\nif you want to use the existing smartforms, you can merge multiple PDFs into\nsingle PDF using ABAP. You will multiple solutions for this by googling.\n\n\n\nLet me know if I did not get your requirement.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nEkansh", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "upvotes": 0, "title": "Re:How to Generate PDF Based on Multiple Selection from Query's Hit List", "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"},
