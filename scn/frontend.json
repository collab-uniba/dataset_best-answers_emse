Thus, the Link ID would not be unique anymore.\n\n\n\nIn the declarative View types (XMLView, HTMLView,...) UI5 automatically takes\ncare of adding the View ID as prefix to make the content IDs unique.\n\nBut in JSViews you are using the constructors directly, so this cannot be done\nautomatically.\n\nSo the solution is to use the \"View.createId(...)\" method to create dynamic\nIDs:\n\n\n\n**var name = new sap.ui.commons.Link(this.createId(\"nameLabel\"), {**\n\n** text: \"Name\",**\n\n** width: \"200px\",**\n\n** enabled :false,**\n\n**});**\n\n\n\nAnd when you want to access this element from the controller by its ID, you\nalso have to take care of this by using this.byId() instead of\nsap.ui.getCore().byId(). But this is equal in all View types.\n\n\n\nThis whole topic is documented here:\n<https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/MVC.html>\n\nBut the control creation in the JSView case is admittedly not pointed out very\nclearly.

here is a\ncopy of the respective section:\n\n\n\n## _OPTIMIZING THE PACKAGE SIZE: DELETE UNNEEDED FILES_\n\n_While the above file is already pretty small (and small enough for inclusion\nin hybrid apps), the size can be further reduced and optimized for specific\napplications by deleting unneeded files:_\n\n  * _In `/resources` you can delete either `sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js` if you reference UI5 normally, or `sap-ui-core.js` if you reference the nojQuery version and reference jQuery separately (e.g. because you run in a Sybase Hybrid Container)._\n  * _In `/resources/sap` you can delete the entire `makit` folder when you do not need the makit charts._\n  * _In `/resources/sap/ui/thirdparty` you can delete the entire `jquery` and `jqueryui` folders when you use the normal `sap-ui-core.js` file for bootstrap (they may only be needed when using the `sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js` script, and even then you may have another copy of jQuery available, so that folder can still be deleted)._\n  * _In `/resources/sap/ui/core/themes` and in `/resources/sap/m/themes` you can delete the \"base\" and the \"sap_bluecrystal\" folder (unless you are using this theme, then you can delete \"base\" and \"sap_mvi\")_\n\n\n\n_Of all JavaScript files there is an optimized and a \"-dbg\" version of each\nfile, so when deleting the above files make sure you always delete both\nversions of them! _\n\n__  \n_If you do not want to allow easy debugging and you want to go for minimum\ninstallation size, also ALL *-dbg.js files can be deleted from the \"-opt-\nstatic\" package._\n\n\n\n_Further files can be deleted, but the size reduction is limited and finding\nout what is not required gets increasingly difficult._\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in the end you will have between ~1 MB and 4 MB, which allows you to\nachieve a reasonable size for your Mobile app.\n\n\n\nIn case you do not use the sap.m library but intend to use the desktop\ncontrols on mobile devices (which will not offer the best experience), you\nhave to add the respective folders, but always can delete the \"test-resources\"\nsubfolder.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:do we have a tool like sencha cmd in sap ui5", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8013.2", "author": "Ajain Vivek", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3394025", "text": "Hi Andreas,\n\n\n\nIs there any way to choose the required controls rather downloading whole\nlibrary something similar to jQueryUI Download Builder.\n\n\n\nI believe inclusion of Custom Library Builder in SAPUI5 would help in\nresolving the size drastically.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAjain", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:do we have a tool like sencha cmd in sap ui5", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8013.3", "author": "Andreas Kunz", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3394025", "text": "Hi Ajain,\n\n\n\nactually there is such a download builder tool, but it is experimental and not\ncontained in the SDN download. The main reasons for that are:\n\n  * It introduces a manual step which may be fine if you want to create a web site, but really breaks the tool chain when you build a product and want to continuously stay on top of the latest library version\n  * Frankly, UI5 covers much more aspects of UI development than jQuery UI and it has 10-15 times as many controls etc. and the modules are more fine-grained, so the number of modules is much higher - and unfortunately this makes the tool harder to use. Of course dependencies can be followed by the tool, but still the overall experience is not what one would expect.\n  * This tool only covers JS, but not CSS.\n  * Partly due to the above reasons, full effort has not been put into this tool, so it is not ready for productive use.\n\n\n\n[![download builder.png](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/\n2-14219657-249885/450-266/download+builder.png)](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/Ji\nveServlet/showImage/2-14219657-249885/download+builder.png)\n\n\n\nNevertheless, it is very obvious that at least for certain usage scenarios a\nsort of optimization build is required. E.g. in mobile networks you want to\nminimize the number of server requests and in weak mobile devices you want to\nminimize the loaded code, even when run from hybrid contaners. And this covers\nnot only UI5 code, but also the application code which can be quite scattered\nwhen using lots of Views.\n\nSo I'd say you can expect some news on this front.\n\n\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:do we have a tool like sencha cmd in sap ui5", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8013.4", "author": "Ajain Vivek", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3394025", "text": "Thanks for useful info Andreas\n![](http://scn.sap.com/1382/images/emoticons/happy.gif)", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:do we have a tool like sencha cmd in sap ui5", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2013-07-24 13:40:00", "resolve": false, "uid": "8014", "title": "Passing input to a oData service", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3396115", "text": "Hi,\n\n\n\n\n\n I am trying to develop a simple mobile application using sapui5.

And will then create a\nblog about it ( I hope find the time for it)\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nDaniel", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Filter in a HTMLView", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8026.5", "author": "John Patterson", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3393598", "text": "Hi Daniel\n\nPlease do write a blog, there is a lot to know, for example I learnt from\nanother one of your questions that you can get SAP OSS support, never knew\nthat.\n\n\n\nOne of the things i like about SAPUI5 you mention above, there are many\ndifferent ways to solve a problem. Having many different techniques does mean\ncomplexity in the undocumented features, but also means that on the whole\nSAPUI5 is more extensible and not as opinionated as other libraries and\nframeworks and that is a good thing.\n\n\n\ncheers\n\njsp", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Filter in a HTMLView", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8026.6", "author": "John Patterson", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3393598", "text": "Hi Frank\n\n![](http://scn.sap.com/1382/images/emoticons/happy.gif) thanks for giving the\nhint needed to get it working.\n\n\n\nHere is gist for the fix [https://gist.github.com/jasper07/4e6f6f1bd1b5a441394\na,](https://gist.github.com/jasper07/4e6f6f1bd1b5a441394a) in my code i put\nthe script which contains the redefined createFilterParams after the\nODataListBinding module has been loaded.\n\n\n\nI am not sure if this is the correct approach.\n\n\n\nIf Daniel wanted to implement the fix i suggest, what would be the recommended\nSAP way to make the needed change?\n\n\n\njsp", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Filter in a HTMLView", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8026.7", "author": "Daniel Rothmund", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3393598", "text": "Hi,\n\n\n\nthx john.\n\n\n\nWith your gist it works !

The biggest difference is that I\nam using SAP Hana studio and I used the wizard to generate the stub files\n(view, controller, index, etc...).\n\n\n\nAfter examining for many hours I notice that the \"todo\" application was\nstructured differently. Below is a screen shot of the todo application.\n\n\n\n[![Parallels DesktopScreenSnapz002.jpg](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet\n/downloadImage/2-14160407-237969/Parallels+DesktopScreenSnapz002.jpg)](http://\nscn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-14160407-237969/Parallels+DesktopS\ncreenSnapz002.jpg)\n\nWhen I used the wizard to create my project it builds a project like what you\nsee below. The big difference being the absence of the app.js file.\n\n\n\n[![Parallels DesktopScreenSnapz003.jpg](http://scn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet\n/downloadImage/2-14160407-237970/Parallels+DesktopScreenSnapz003.jpg)](http://\nscn.sap.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-14160407-237970/Parallels+DesktopS\ncreenSnapz003.jpg)\n\nWhen I use the wizard structure the syntax to bind the model to the view in\nthe controller seems to have no effect.\n\n\n\nonInit: **function**() {\n\n **var** data = { name : \"Button!\"};\n\n **this**.model = **new** sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel();\n\n **this**.model.setData(data);\n\n **this**.getView().setModel(**this**.model);\n\n},\n\n\n\nHere is what I try to do in the view.\n\n\n\nsap.ui.jsview(\"mymvc3.myMVC3\", {\n\n\n\n getControllerName : **function**() {\n\n **return** \"mymvc3.myMVC3\";\n\n },\n\n\n\n createContent : **function**(oController) {\n\n\n\n  **var** button = **new** sap.ui.commons.Button({text:'{/name}'});\n\n  button.placeAt('content');\n\n  **var** textField = **new** sap.ui.commons.TextField(\"username\", { value:'{/name}' });\n\n  textField.placeAt('content');\n\n\n\n }\n\n\n\n});\n\n\n\nNo luck!.\n\n\n\nWhen I build a new project and refactored the code to have the \"todo\" MVC\nstructure is started working. ???? Anyone have any idea what is going on here?\nI am glad I found a workaround and like using the \"todo\" structure but why\nwould that make a difference?\n\n\n\nIt takes time to set the structure up like the \"todo\" project. I don't want\nto have to go back and refactor the code every time. Is there a best practice\nhere. The examples online (while good) seem to stuff everything into the view\nand ignore the controller. The \"todo\" app was the best example I could find\nonline that used the view.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.", "views": "94", "answers": 2, "author": "Clark Dennison", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ["ui5", "mvc"]}, {"date_time": "2013-06-28 05:50:00", "resolve": "solution", "uid": "8095.1", "author": "Ian MacGregor", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3382499", "text": "Hi Clark,\n\n\n\nRather than using placeAt directly inside createContent, you should be using\nthis function simply to return the content of your view, then the view itself\nis placed within your page.

Now this works for regular controls, however for complex\ncontrols that have its own property resources, it does not seem to work. The\ntable property files such as - messagebundle_en.properties run into JS errors\nwhen used with a namespace.\n\n\n\n In case we use without a namespace, it works fine.\n\n\n\n Anyone have any suggestions on what could be done here?\n\n\n\nCheers,  \nPrashanth", "views": "1202", "answers": 2, "author": "Prashanth K S", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ["bsp", "icf", "namespace", "ui5"]}, {"date_time": "2013-05-15 15:27:00", "resolve": "solution", "uid": "8129.1", "author": "Silke Arians", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3340205", "text": "Dear Prashanth,\n\n\n\nIt seems that you use the UI5 App Handler under sap/bc/ui5_ui5.\n\nIf you create a BSP app with namespace, you also need to create the namespace\nin the TA sicf under sap/bc/ui5_ui5.\n\nWhen using the UI5 App Handler, please ensure that the text-based files are\nBSP pages or page fragments whereas the binary files are MIME objects in the\nBSP app.\n\n\n\nBut manually creating the BSP app and the content is not the supported\nscenario by SAP - please use the SAPUI5 Application Development Tool instead\nfor creating the UI5 App in Eclipse and then upload it to the ABAP server via\nthe SAPUI5 Team Provider for &gt;= 7.31 or the ABAP report for &lt; 7.31.

You can see the code here: <https://github.com/qma\ncro/sapui5bin/blob/master/snippets/model_to_html.html#L31>\n\n\n\nI noticed in the docu that the Paginator inherits a number of bind methods\nfrom sap.ui.core.Element, and was curious to see whether binding a Paginator\ncould auto-set the numberOfPages according to the data.\n\n\n\nAnyone tried this?", "views": "676", "answers": 3, "author": "DJ Adams", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ["jquery", "model", "sapui5", "paginator"]}, {"date_time": "2012-12-28 10:31:00", "resolve": "solution", "uid": "8146.1", "author": "Andreas Kunz", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3280414", "text": "Hi DJ,\n\n\n\nthe inherited \"bind\" methods are the generic ones that can be used to bind\n**any **property or aggregation of **any **Control.\n\n(there may be exceptions, where a property documentation says that setting the\nvalue is only possible at certain times or so, but this is at least the\ngeneral rule)\n\n\n\nHowever, the \"numberOfPages\" is a number property, so you can only bind it to\na number which is present in the model. So either the service that provides\nyour blog entries needs to also provide the count or you need to do the\ncounting yourself.\n\nWhen you really want to use the binding (so the count and the paginator would\nautomatically adapt if a new blog post is added to the Model) you can use a\nformatter function in the binding:\n\n\n\n oPaginator.bindProperty(\"numberOfPages\", \"/entry\", function(value) {\n\n // binding goes against the array, so \"value\" is the whole array now...\n\n // this formatter returns the array length, which is the blog post count\n\n if (value){\n\n return value.length;\n\n }\n\n return 0;\n\n });\n\n\n\nActually I'm not 100% sure how such a property binding agains an array reacts\non data changes and whether this usage is intended and fully supported, but at\nleast it does work. ;-)\n\n\n\nSee a running example here (only runs in Chrome/Firefox, not in IE, because\nUI5 is loaded cross-domain):\n\n<http://jsbin.com/aku_paginator_bound/2/edit>\n\n\n\nCheers - and a Happy New Year!\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Bind Paginator to model?", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8146.2", "author": "DJ Adams", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3280414", "text": "Hey Andreas\n\n\n\nThanks for answering, and what a lovely answer it was too.

While researching how data might flow between the layers I found\ntwo approaches to exchange data between the ABAP layer and SAPUI5.\n\n\n\nSAP Netweaver Gateways seems to be the solution of choice. However it comes\nwith additional license costs. On the other hand I found a blog how to create\nREST/JSON based web service in ABAP to provide data for SAPUI5 ([Building a\nCRUD Application with SAPUI5 and ICF REST/JSON Service - Part\n1](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-\nend/blog/2012/12/07/building-a-crud-application-with-sapui5-and-icf-restjson-\nservice--part-1) ). This blog comes with the initial requirement of using ABAP\nand SAPUI5 without SAP Gateways. Skipping both the blog and information about\nconsuming ODate with Gateways from SAPUI5 I wonder about the difference\nbetween the two approaches.\n\n\n\nAs what I can see the data will be handled just alike in SAPUI5 as it will\nbecome a JSON model or OData model - both are similarly bound. So from the UI\nperspective there shouldn't be a difference. Or am I missing something?\n\n\n\nFrom the ABAP perspective I see that SAP Netweaver Gateway offers me a UI to\ncreate my OData service, whereas the linked blog needs additional coding to\nachieve that. However: the actual \"doing\" in the second approach should be\neasily repeatable for every object.\n\n\n\nI would expect the Netweaer Gateway to provide me with additional\nfunctionality to build fancy new UIs if it demands licence costs. However all\nmy research about \"advantage of SAP Gateways\" points to fact that it uses REST\nservice. But that's exactly what the blog also does. If there's not more about\nSAP Gateways, I don't see a good argument to pay for SAP Netweaver Gateways\n(from the cost perspective of my boss).\n\n\n\nI'm sure I'm missing something on that. But my research always points to the\n\"cross-platform\" argument based on the fact that Gateways offer me REST based\nservices. Can anyone give me a hint? Or am I underestimating the amount of\nwork for the approach in the blog?\n\n\n\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPhilipp", "views": "1395", "answers": 2, "author": "Philipp Hhne", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ["rest", "json", "odata", "sapui5", "gateway_consumption"]}, {"date_time": "2013-05-30 09:18:00", "resolve": "solution", "uid": "8157.1", "author": "Graham Robinson", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3366681", "text": "Hi Philipp,\n\n\n\na few observations.\n\n\n\nFirstly, as you rightly mention, the Gateway tools effectively generate the\nservices for you without coding whereas you would need to code all this\nyourself if you chose to use your own ICF handler. This is not necessarily a\nhuge task as with either alternative the back end functionality still needs to\nbe built. It may be that you can use existing functionality or you may need to\nbuild it all yourself - this effort would be pretty much the same in either\nscenario. But having a single toolset such as that provided by Gateway to\nbuild, publish and manage the API's should make life easier, quicker and allow\nthe developer to focus on the important business functionality rather than the\nplumbing.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I do not believe there is any major differences in the licensing\nrequirements no matter whether you use a Gateway service or your own ICF\nhandler. As long as the end user is a so-called \"named user\" and therefore\nlicensed to use the SAP backend for the functionality they are calling then my\nunderstanding is that the existing user license covers access to that\nfunctionality whether it happens via SAPGUI, Gateway, ICF handers, or any\nother method. If, on the other hand, your users connect as so-called \"unnamed\nusers\" my understanding is that you will need to obtain appropriate licensing\nfor such use. The good news about Gateway is that such a license arrangement\nin on the SAP price list. For a custom ICF handler you would need to figure\nthat out with SAP. As always with licensing issues check with the SAP Account\nExec.\n\n\n\nThirdly, there advantages to using oData services, such as those provided by\nGateway, over the JSON example from the blog. Most obviously oData supports\nstandard attributes that allow the client to request very granular subsets\nfrom a data collection. This has advantages if the UI controls, such as those\nprovided by SAPUI5, also support oData. So, for example, a tableView control\ncan just request the 10 records that it needs to display on the screen from a\nlarge collection and the Gateway service will ensure only those 10 records are\nreturned. As the user navigates through the collection the tableView control\nrequests the relevant chunks of data from the backend. This all happens\nwithout the developer having to code anything to support it.\n\n\n\nFinally, Gateway includes a number of plugins for common developer tools such\nas Eclipse, Visual Studio and XCode that can accelerate the development\nprocess.

The OData specification\nincludes directives like $filter, $top and $skip that are used so the client\ncan specify in the call exactly what data it needs.\n\n\n\nSo, for example, a call such as `[http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc/Pr\noducts?$top=5&$skip=2](http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc/Products?%24t\nop=5&%24skip=2) `would return the 3rd though the 7th entry in the entity set.\n\n\n\nObviously the support for these directives needs to be implemented in both the\nclient-side controls and the API itself.

Defining the input parameters named **oInput1** and **oInput2** for the **press **event handler of the button. The press even handler syntax does not support this and hence, when you try to access these two input fields, within the event handler, it is basically the undefined local variable that will be used.\n  2. **this **keyword will be used in the controllers and views to refer to the current instance of the controller/view. It should not be used in the the html page.\n\n\n\nSo remove the two additional input parameters from the **press** event handler\nand do not use **this** keyword to access the UI.\n\n\n\nBelow is the corrected code:\n\n> var oButton4 = new sap.ui.commons.Button({\n\n>\n\n>  text : \"Submit\",\n\n>\n\n>  style: sap.ui.commons.ButtonStyle.Emph,\n\n>\n\n>  press : function(oEvent) {\n\n>\n\n>  var jURL =\n'<http://XXXX.com:1080/Security/updateApp.xsjs';>\n\n>\n\n>  jQuery.ajax({\n\n>\n\n>  url:jURL,\n\n>\n\n>  method: 'POST',\n\n>\n\n>  dataType:'json',\n\n>\n\n>  data: '{\"app_id\":\"' + oInput1.getValue() +\n'\",\"app_desc\":\"' + oInput2.getLiveValue() + '\",\"locale\":\"en\"}',\n\n>\n\n>  success: myFunction.onComplete,\n\n>\n\n>  error: myFunction.onErrorCall\n\n>\n\n>  });\n\n>\n\n>   }\n\n>\n\n> }).placeAt(\"content\");\n\nRegards,\n\nVishweshwara P.K.M.", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getValue' of undefined", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8183.2", "author": "Naresh Veeramachineni", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3355631", "text": "Hi, Thanks for the response.

This means the height depends\non the content.\n\nBut the Carousel by default takes 100% height to cover all available space.\nThis means the height depends on the parent.\n\nAnd you'll notice this is a loop: child and parent make their height depend on\neach other. The result is that the height collapses to zero (or in this case\nto the Carousel ruler which has a defined height).\n\nThis is a standard problem in CSS: 100% height needs a parent with defined\nheight.\n\n\n\nIf this is the cause, the fix is simple: just set the \"enableScrolling\"\nproperty of the Page to \"false\". This means it will no longer depend on the\nsize of the content, but the height of the Page content are will be fixed to\n100% of the Page.\n\nAnd the Carousel then knows how much 100% height are.\n\n\n\nYou don't want to scroll the Carousel vertically, after all, do you? If you'd\nwant that, you'd need to set it to a fixed height (as proposed by Alejandro).\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:sap.m.Carousel not working within sap.m.SplitApp", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8200.5", "author": "Stefan Ltterle", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3346653", "text": "It works, thank you for the detailed information!", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:sap.m.Carousel not working within sap.m.SplitApp", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2013-04-26 07:50:00", "resolve": false, "uid": "8201", "title": "CVOM GeoMaps Error", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3349684", "text": "Hi ,\n\n\n\nImplementing geo maps getting this error\n\n\n\n2Error: Problem parsing\nd=\"M65.25,NaNL195.75,NaNL326.25,NaNL456.75,NaNL587.25,NaNL717.75,NaN\"\n\ngeoFeatures: does not meet min or max number of feed definition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow to resolve this issue here is my code\n\n\n\nvar Environment = sap.viz.env;\n\n var CrosstableDataset = sap.viz.data.CrosstableDataset;\n\n var vizcore = sap.viz.core;\n\n sap.viz.GeoManager.resourcePath('extension/viz.ext.geomaps/resources');\n\n\n\n Environment.initialize({\n\n 'log': 'debug'\n\n });\n\n\n\n var chartOption = {\n\n title: {\n\n visible: true,\n\n text: 'Geo Bubble Chart Sample'\n\n }\n\n };\n\n\n\n\n\n var ds = new CrosstableDataset();\n\n\n\n\n\n var navValues = [{\n\n featureId: 'C21019301,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'New York'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C21086811,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'Vancouver'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C21155525,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'Montral'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C21156103,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'Ottawa'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C21055407,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'Toronto'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C23039216,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'Rio de Janeiro'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C23380551,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: '-'\n\n }, {\n\n featureId: 'C20337455,NAVTEQ',\n\n name: 'London'\n\n }, {\n\n latLong: [0, 0],\n\n name: 'Center'\n\n }];\n\n\n\n\n\n var values = [];\n\n var infos = [];\n\n\n\n\n\n var measures = [],\n\n min = 18,\n\n max = 150,\n\n v, setNull = false;\n\n\n\n\n\n $.each(navValues, function(i, v) {\n\n values.push(v.name);\n\n infos.push({\n\n featureId: navValues[i].featureId,\n\n latLong: navValues[i].latLong\n\n });\n\n\n\n\n\n v = Math.round(Math.random() * max);\n\n if (v &lt;= min) {\n\n if (setNull) {\n\n v = null;\n\n } else {\n\n v = 'invalid value';\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n setNull = !setNull;\n\n }\n\n measures.push(v);\n\n });\n\n\n\n\n\n ds.setData({\n\n 'analysisAxis': [{\n\n 'index': 1,\n\n 'data': [{\n\n 'type': 'Dimension',\n\n 'name': 'Region',\n\n 'values': values,\n\n 'infos': infos\n\n }]\n\n }],\n\n 'measureValuesGroup': [{\n\n 'index': 1,\n\n 'data': [{\n\n 'type': 'Measure',\n\n 'name': 'Number of Planes',\n\n 'values': [measures]\n\n }]\n\n }]\n\n });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$('#chart').empty();\n\n var bar = vizcore.createViz({\n\n type: 'viz/geobubble',\n\n data: ds,\n\n container: $('#chart'),\n\n options: chartOption\n\n });", "views": "264", "answers": 0, "author": "Ramakrishna M", "upvotes": 0, "type": "question", "tags": ["sapui5;ui5;html5;"]}, {"date_time": "2013-04-26 06:41:00", "resolve": false, "uid": "8202", "title": "Sap cvom geomap error", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3349581", "text": "Hi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to implement geomaps in my app the following error shows up any\nidea to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\n  1.

For\nBYD UI, there is Oberon client and Oberon Runtime. To reduce the interaction\nroundtrip and formalize backend interaction pattern, Oberon client can\naccumulate backend requests, compare data and derive the data change list, and\nbind client action to backend operation of server controller(ECO or new\ncontroller with CIP), then the backend controller(master controller) can\ncontrol the interaction lifecycle. One roundtrip also is the backend\ntransaction unit. But with UI5, all these things are missing, or developers\nhave to write custom model to include the backend service calls. one could\nforesee more server requests are required and interaction is not formalized,\nwhich might brings mess for product development, but not a problem for small\nproject.\n\n\n\nUI5 is based on MVC, while BYD UI is more like ASP.Net(Server controlled UI),\nare there any best practice to balance the cons and pros of 2 UI patterns?

A Control is an UI object which\nrenders itself where an Element is rendered by it's aggregating control.\nTherefore it is not possible to extend an Element and add a renderer to the\nElement. This will not work.\n\n\n\nFor now I would live with the following workaround, that after the rendering\nyou use jQuery to find your TreeNodes and set the custom attributes. Therfore\nyou have to overwrite the Tree and the TreeNode:\n\n\n\n    \n    \n     sap.ui.commons.Tree.extend(\"my.Tree\", {\n     \n     onAfterRendering: function(oEvent) {\n     sap.ui.commons.Tree.prototype.onAfterRendering.apply(this, arguments);\n     var fnUpdateNodes = function(aNodes) {\n     jQuery.each(aNodes, function(iIndex, oNode) {\n     if (oNode.getImcpid && oNode.getImcpid()) {\n     \n     jQuery.sap.byId(oNode.getId()).attr(\"imcpid\", oNode.getImcpid());\n     }\n     });\n     }\n     fnUpdateNodes(this.getNodes());\n     },\n     \n     renderer: {}\n     \n     });\n     \n     sap.ui.commons.TreeNode.extend(\"my.TreeNode\", {\n     \n     metadata: {\n     properties: {\n     \"imcpid\": \"string\"\n     }\n     }\n     \n     });\n\n\n\nBTW: the function renderInnerAttributes is a specific hook of the\nTextFieldRenderer which is used to add custom attributes in controls which\nextend the TextField, like the DropDown, ComboBox, ... The Tree has not such a\nhook yet.\n\n\n\nBest regards and happy weekend,\n\nPeter", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:extend TreeNode in SAPUI5", "upvotes": 2, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8228.2", "author": "Chris Wohlbrecht", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3338223", "text": "Hi Peter,\n\n\n\nthanks for the reply.

Some of\nthem use **_transform_** css property, other use **_-webkit-transform_**\n\n\n\n3\\. Attached handler for event onBeforeShow scrolls the List.\n\n    \n    \n    this.getView().addDelegate({ onBeforeShow: function(evt) { \n    if (evt.direction == \"back\") {\n    oList.posContainer.css('transform',oList.posTransform); \n    oList.posContainer.css('-webkit-transform',oList.posTransformWebKit); \n    }\n    }});\n\n\n\nthis code is placed inside onInit() method of the view controller.\n\nscrolling is done via css.\n\n\n\nChecked on iPhone: position set correctly, but the next tap on the List leads\nto flicking.\n\nI think, it's a safari issue.

And in general you don't get everything for\nfree on mobile devices.\n\n\n\nAs one example: you can't just have a &lt;div&gt; with overflow:auto to make\nthe content scrollable, as you are used to do in desktop browsers. Mobile\nbrowsers just won't scroll. The newest versions try to make up for that with\nother CSS properties, but support is buggy and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out that there is some effort involved to make\nweb UIs work across devices. And when we talk about something like responsive\nlayout, then this doesn't mean everything happens by magic, but someone has to\nactually do something to make it behave as desired.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that most JavaScript libraries have a version for desktop\nbrowsers and one for touch devices (e.g. jQuery UI and jQuery mobile, ExtJS\nand Sencha Touch,...). I guess that technical differences as well as different\ntarget user experience were the reason for this.\n\n\n\nEven in SAPUI5, another such library, there is a control set (the \"sap.m\"\nlibrary) optimized for touch devices only, while the other controls are mainly\ntargeting desktop browsers. Note that the library core itself is identical in\nthe case of SAPUI5, which makes cross-platform development easier.\n\n\n\nThe SAPUI5 demokit which you have tried on iPad has been built with those\ndesktop-optimized controls. They have a fair share of touch enablement (e.g.\nif the screen is narrow, you can scroll the workset items on top of the Shell\nwith your finger and Konstantin pointed out that the control itself actually\nwould allow scrolling). But there are things which do not fully work yet and\nyou have spotted one of those, where the SDK application seems to have broken\nthe scrolling behavior.\n\nThanks for letting us know - this should indeed be improved.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:UI5 SAP Help on Safari", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8285.3", "author": "Kumar Jayant", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3310864", "text": "Hi Andreas,\n\n\n\nThanks for the explanation.\n\n\n\nJust to be clear, Are you saying that even before the start of development, we\nneed to be clear about the device on which the application is to be used?\n\n\n\nIf this is true, then we have different set of choices to start with. For\nexample, for desktop applications in SAP, we could use WDA(comes in the game\nas it being enhanced to have better look and feel  Update from SAP in one\nof the workshops attended in Waldorf ). Similarly, for mobile devices, we\nwould have native languages(iOS, Android, etc) to be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nOR, we design for one device and have the possibility to extend it to other\ndevices with minor changes?\n\nThis is what I believe(or say expect) of SAP UI5.\n\n\n\nIts quite important to have good understanding on what will/will not work on\nwhich device while designing and developing.

View/Controller are again\npart of the UI5 core, not of a mobile or desktop library.\n\n  \nThere is a \"desktop\" Button added to the View in this case, so you could call\nit a desktop app. But adding a sap.m.Button to the View instead, making it a\n\"mobile app\" would not change its initialization behavior.\n\n\n\nThe difference you observe is probably caused by how/when you instantiate the\nView: maybe you have a sap.ui.ux3.Shell on desktop and the views are\ninstantiated lazily once the user clicks on the respective workset item. So\nonInit is only called for the one View you choose to instantiate immediately.\n\nAnd in your mobile app you instantiate all Views at the same time and add them\nto the App control. So onInit is called on all immediately.\n\n\n\nThis would lead to the behavior you mention, but is solely caused by your\nchoice when to instantiate the View.

I think it rather means that\nthe license for the SCN version only allows you to use it for testing, not for\nproductive scenarios.\n\nSAPUI5 comes with several SAP products/platforms (like SAP NetWeaver Cloud)\nand to my understanding that version of SAPUI5 has the proper license also for\nproductive use. There are certain parts marked as \"experimental\", but I don't\nthink the library as such is still considered \"beta\".\n\n\n\nThe real question is what exactly you expect from a non-beta version: a\ncertain (informal) level of maturity/stability? A certain level of formally\nguaranteed support?\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course you can combine plain HTML5 elements and SAPUI5 controls. In fact,\nSAPUI5 controls are composed of and make use of HTML5 elements, but you are\nalways free to use as much HTML(5) as you want - or other HTML/JavaScript\nlibraries - in combination with UI5.\n\nThe same is valid for the usage of other web standards which are closely\nrelated to HTML5, like CSS3.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:SAPUI5 - Beta?", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2013-02-04 08:10:00", "resolve": false, "uid": "8306", "title": "Authentication Issues", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3302686", "text": "I am developing an UI with HTML5.

Java applets could also be used from within\nUI5 (UI5 does not put any limits on what you can do).\n\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of keeping the natural separation between server\nand client could be discussed in length, but apart from responsiveness the\nseparation can also help keeping the application more cleanly structured and\nmaintainable, it enables backend code to stay stable for years while UIs are\nenhanced, updated and exchanged much more often to keep a pleasing user\nexperience making use of the newest browser features.\n\nAnd of course this separation makes the UI technology independent from server\ntechnologies: when you know a client-side framework like SAPUI5 (or YahooUI or\nwhatever), you can write web UIs for Java servers as well as for ABAP or\nMicrosoft .net servers. With JSPs on the other side you could only code UIs\nfor Java servers.\n\n\n\nYou do not NEED to use JSON with REST, but you need to somehow offer data at a\nweb interface, yes. OData with Gateway is just a proposal how different server\ntechnologies can offer data and functionality in a way so different client\ntechnologies know how to consume and use it.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Accessing SAP Data via Portal APIs in HTML5", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2013-01-04 09:20:00", "resolve": true, "uid": "8329", "title": "Post method in sap.m app", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3287884", "text": "Hi,\n\n\n\nIs there anyone who can show me some code of a sapui5 mobile app with a POST\nmethod or a full CRUD?

In IE (less than 10) there exists the XDomainRequest\nobject, which implements CORS (but it has a number of limitations in contrast\nto XMLHttpRequest with CORS).\n\nBut since most of the existing services currently do not support CORS, I would\nsuggest to configure / install a reverse proxy (Apache, SAP Web Dispatcher,\n...), which directs the requests to the correct origin (and simulates a single\norigin to the browser).\n\nWe are currently working on an extension to the End2End Tutorial\n<http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-33792>, which will cover the cross-origin topic.\n\nHth, Bernhard", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:SAPUI5 Cross-origin resource sharing issues while Posting to backend.", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8338.5", "author": "Vincent Wouters", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3275255", "text": "Haay Bernhard,\n\n\n\nI will look into your document, read it and post back any questions I still\nhave.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nVincent", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:SAPUI5 Cross-origin resource sharing issues while Posting to backend.", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8338.6", "author": "Bernhard Siewert", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3275255", "text": "Hi Vincent,\n\nsorry, but the document itself just describes the implementation and\nconsumption of OData Services with SAPUI5 within the same system (so there is\nno validation of the Same-Origin Policy).

An application may choose to display entirely\ndifferent content for each NavigationItem, or alternatively to just use these\nitems as filters and modify the data displayed in the content. Or an\napplication may completely destroy content that is currently not displayed (to\nsave memory) or just use CSS to make that content invisible, without even\nreally removing it from the Shell (to save re-rendering time or avoid other\nproblems).  \nHence there is no direct connection between NavigationItems and the content\nwhich belongs to them. Instead, the Shell just fires events and the\napplication can/must do whatever is required to display the right content.\n\n\n\nSo what you want to do is to write a handler for the \"worksetItemChanged\"\nevent of the Shell and then act depending on the selected item. It is good\npractice to set the \"key\" of all the items and to then read it in the event\nhandler.  \nThe getContent() method and the mContent[key] map is one suggestion how to\nmanage/lazycreate/cache the different sets of content.  \nYour pastie code already does this, actually works fine, and already displays\ndifferent content for different NavigationItems, so you seem do do it right...\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add another toplevel item, you could add it in the Shell constructor:\n\n\n\n**worksetItems:[ // add some items to the top navigation**  \n** new sap.ui.ux3.NavigationItem({key:\"wi_people\",text:\"People\",subItems:[ // the \"Home\" workcenter also gets three sub-items**  \n** new sap.ui.ux3.NavigationItem({key:\"wi_people_overview\",text:\"Overview\"}),**  \n** new sap.ui.ux3.NavigationItem({key:\"wi_people_add\",text:\"Add\"})**  \n** ]}),**  \n** new sap.ui.ux3.NavigationItem({key:\"wi_mine\",text:\"My Own\")**  \n**]**\n\n\n\nAnd in getContent() you just add another else-if:  \n** } else if (key == \"wi_mine\") {**  \nand return the appropriate content.\n\n\n\nIf you want to display more than one Button and to lay out those controls, you\nshould look into the Layout controls provided by SAPUI5.\n\n\n\nBest regards  \nAndreas", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Add Controls & Content to NavigationItems", "upvotes": 2, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8350.2", "author": "Vincent Wouters", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3272774", "text": "Thanks for your reply Andreas!

This is not guaranteed but has to be proven\nwith corresponding measurements. Nevertheless it might be desirable to enhance\nor replace the actual UI5 module loading with an alternative like RequireJS or\nAMD (Asynchronous Module Definition). We are investigating async module\nloading in UI5 but I cannot say whether or when it will be available.\n\n\n\nFor the time being I recommend to look at the following SAPUI5 Developer Guide\ndocuments related to your question ...\n\n\n\n  * on the bootstraping process: ['Loading / Initializing SAPUI5 within an HTML Page](https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/Bootstrap.html)'. There you can find more details on the given alterantives to load SAPUI5 resources in your application (extract: \"_There is a broad range of alternatives, how the SAPUI5 runtime and controls can be integrated into an HTML page. Common to all alternatives is the need to load and execute at least one UI5 specific JavaScript resource.\"_) \n  * on [modularization and dependency management](https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/sdk/docs/guide/ModularizationConcept.html): extract: _\"The UI5 framework has built-in support for modularizing comprehensive JavaScript applications. That means, instead of defining and loading one large bundle of JavaScript code, an application can be splitted into smaller parts which then can be loaded at runtime at the time when they are needed. These smaller individual files are called Modules. ...\" _\n\n\n\nRegards, Bertram", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Minimizing the javascript footprint", "upvotes": 1, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2012-10-30 15:06:00", "resolve": false, "uid": "8355", "title": "SAPUI5 for mobile", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3259121", "text": "Hi,\n\n\n\ndoes anybody know, when SAPUI5 will be optimized for mobile devices?\n\n\n\nStatus of today, what are the recommended ui frameworks for mobile ui\ndevelopment?

I removed the \"eq true\" and they kind of worked (see second\nissue below)\n\n\n\nContains uses indexOf which returns \"Invalid function 'indexOf' detected\" when\nused against a Gateway service. I believe it should be using substringof\ninstead which works as I would expect contains to work (I, CP, *&lt;val&gt;*\nin IT_FILTER_SELECT_OPTIONS ).\n\n\n\nThe second issue I found was that SAPUI5 removes the first row of the query.\n\n\n\neg. if i use sap.ui.model.FilterOperator.EQ like\n\n    \n    \n    var oModel = initModel(sURI, false),\n     oBinding = oModel.bindList(\"Categories\"),\n     oFilter = new sap.ui.model.Filter(\"CategoryName\", sap.ui.model.FilterOperator.EQ, \"Beverages\");\n\n\n\nFor the above call, one row is returned from the Gateway service, however this\nentity is not returned in the bindings context.

We had to do an\nimportant cleanup here before we roll out SAPUI5 to a wider community.\n\n> **Required changes in the application when moving from 1.4 to 1.6:**\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> To fix the application, you have to change all bindings, which have a\nrelative path (without a slash at the beginning), but are not used within a\nlist-binding template, or an area where a binding context is explicitely\ndefined with either \"bindContext\" or \"setBindingContext\".\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> So whenever you want your path to be resolved starting with the root-Element\nof the data model, you have to add a slash at the beginning of the binding\npath:\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> bindValue(\"name\") ---&gt; bindValue(\"/name\")\n\n>\n\n> bindRows(\"Orders\") ---&gt; bindRows(\"/Orders\")\n\n>\n\n> { value: \"{name}\" } ---&gt; { value: \"{/name}\" }\n\n\n\nThe new syntax also work in the SAPUI5 1.4 version - so in general it might be\nmuch safer to adapt to the above mentioned principle. In any case you do an\nabsolute binding to the root element of the model just put add a leading slash\nto the path.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nPeter", "views": "N/A", "answers": "N/A", "title": "Re:Bug report data binding DropDownBox v1.6.3", "upvotes": 0, "type": "answer", "tags": "N/A"}, {"date_time": "2015-12-02 00:00:00", "resolve": "", "uid": "8387.2", "author": "Martin Jonsson", "url": "http://scn.sap.com/thread/3240152", "text": "Hello Peter.\n\n\n\nYou are absolutely right, I did check the new documentation but honestly could\nhave looked for days without seeing this subtle difference.

The logic behind\nmy comment is; OData model binding is based on Query operation type. So for\nREAD and QUERY we will use HTTP GET, similarly POST for Create records and\netc.\n\n\n\nWe cannot distinguish the operations based on URI as the URI is common for all\noperations. So we need to explicitly mention the type of operation we are\ngoing to perform on the URI by mentioning method type.\n\n\n\nThe REST service has certain patters to follow, these become restrictions for\nthe Two way binding. For example the POST method which intern calls Create\noperation requires all the parameters to be passed irrespective of usage.

While the DOM element can be used and modified, the\ngeneral caveats for working with SAPUI5 control DOM elements apply.
